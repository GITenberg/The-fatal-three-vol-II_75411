</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Castellani’s</span> existence was one of those social
problems about which the idle world loves to speculate.
There are a good many people in London to
whom the idea of a fourth dimension is not half so
interesting as the notion of a man who lives by his
wits, and yet contrives to get himself dressed by a
good tailor, and to obtain a footing in some of the
best houses at the smart end of the town. This
problem César Castellani had offered to the polite
world of London for the last three seasons.</p>

<p>Who is Mr. Castellani? was a question still asked
by a good many people who invited the gentleman
to their houses, and made much of him. He had
not forced his way into society; nobody had the
right to describe him as a pushing person. He had
slipped so insidiously into his place in the social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
orbit that people had not yet left off wondering how
he came there, or who had been his sponsors. This
kind of speculation always stimulates the invention
of the clever people; and these affected to know a
good deal more about Mr. Castellani than he knew
about himself.</p>

<p>“He came with magnificent credentials, and an
account was opened for him at Coutts’s before he
arrived,” said Magnus Dudley, the society poet,
flinging back his long hair with a lazy movement of
the large languid head. “Of course, you know that
he is a natural son of Cavour’s?”</p>

<p>“Indeed! No, I never heard <em>that</em>. He is not
like Cavour.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but he is the image of his
mother—one of the handsomest women in Italy—a
Duchess, and daughter of a Roman Prince, who could
trace his descent in an unbroken line from Germanicus.
Castellani has the blood of Caligula in his
veins.”</p>

<p>“He looks like it; but I have heard on pretty
good authority that he is the son of a Milanese
music-master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“There are people who will tell you his father
wheeled a barrow and sold penny ices in Whitechapel,”
retorted Magnus. “People will say anything.”</p>

<p>Thus and in much otherwise did society speculate;
and in the meantime Mr. Castellani’s circle
was always widening. His book had been just audacious
enough and just clever enough to hit the
gold in the literary target. <em>Nepenthe</em> had been one
of the successes of the season before last: and Mr.
Castellani was henceforth to be known as the author
of <em>Nepenthe</em>. He had touched upon many things
below the stars, and some things beyond them. He
had written of other worlds with the confidence of a
man who had been there. He had written of women
with the air of a Café de Paris Solomon; and he had
written of men as if he had never met one.</p>

<p>A man who could write a successful book, and
could sing and play divinely, was a person to be cultivated
in feminine society. Very few men cared to
be intimate with Mr. Castellani, but among women
his influence was indisputable. He treated them
with a courtly deference which charmed them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
he made them his slaves. No Oriental despot ever
ruled more completely than César Castellani did in
half-a-dozen of those drawing-rooms which give the
tone to scores of other drawing rooms between Mayfair
and Earl’s Court. He contrived to be in request
from the dawn to the close of the London season. He
had made a favour of going to Riverdale; and now,
although it suited his purpose to be there, he made
a favour of staying.</p>

<p>“If it were not for the delight of being here, I
should be in one of the remotest valleys in the Tyrol,”
he told Mrs. Hillersdon. “I have never stayed in
England so long after the end of the season. A wild
longing to break loose from the bonds of Philistinism
generally seizes me at this time of the year. I want
to go away, and away, and ever away from my fellow-men.
I should like to go and live in a tomb, like
the girl in Ouida’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Maremma</i>. My thirst for
solitude is a disease.”</p>

<p>This from a man who spent the greater part of
his existence dawdling in drawing-rooms and boudoirs
sounded paradoxical; but paradoxes are accepted
graciously from a man who has written the book of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the season. Louise Hillersdon treated Castellani
like a favourite son. At his bidding she brought out
the old guitar which had slumbered in its case for
nearly a decade, and sang the old Spanish songs,
and struck the strings with the old dashing sweep
of a delicate hand, and graceful curve of a rounded
arm.</p>

<p>“When you sing I could believe you as young as
Helen when Paris stole her,” said Castellani, lolling
along the sofa beside the low chair in which she was
sitting; “I cease to envy the men who knew you
when you were a girl.”</p>

<p>“My dear Castellani, I feel old enough to be
your grandmother; unless you are really the person
I sometimes take you for—”</p>

<p>“Who may that be?”</p>

<p>“The Wandering Jew.”</p>

<p>“No matter what my creed or where I have wandered,
since I am so happy as to find a haven here.
Granted that I can remember Nero’s beautiful Empress,
and Faustina, and all that procession of fair
women who illumine the Dark Ages—and Mary of
Scotland, and Emma Hamilton, blonde and brunette,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
pathetic and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">espiègle</i>, every type, and every variety.
It is enough for me to find perfection here.”</p>

<p>“If you only knew how sick I am of that kind of
nonsense!” said Mrs. Hillersdon, smiling at him,
half in amusement, half in scorn.</p>

<p>“O, I know that you have drunk the wine of
men’s worship to satiety! Yet if you and I had
lived upon the same plane, I would have taught you
that among a hundred adorers one could love you
better than all the rest. But it is too late. Our
souls may meet and touch perhaps thousands of years
hence in a new incarnation.”</p>

<p>“Do you talk this kind of nonsense to Mrs.
Greswold or her niece?”</p>

<p>“No; with them I am all dulness and propriety.
Neither lady is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">simpatica</i>. Miss Ransome is a frank,
good-natured girl—much too frank—with all the
faults of her species. I find the genus girl universally
detestable.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ransome has about fifteen hundred a year.
I suppose you know that?”</p>

<p>“Has she really? If ever I marry I hope to do
better than that,” answered César with easy insolence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
“She would be a very nice match for a
country parson; that Mr. Rollinson, for instance,
who is getting up the concert.”</p>

<p>“Then Miss Ransome is not your attraction at
Enderby? It is Mrs. Greswold who draws you.”</p>

<p>“Why should I be drawn?” he asked, with his
languid air. “I go there in sheer idleness. They
like me to make music for them; they fool me and
praise me; and it is pleasant to be fooled by two
pretty women.”</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Greswold take any part in the fooling?
She looks like marble.”</p>

<p>“There is fire under that marble. Mrs. Greswold
is romantically in love with her husband: but
that is a complaint which is not incurable.”</p>

<p>“He is not an agreeable man,” said Louise,
remembering how long George Greswold and his
wife had kept aloof from her. “And he does not
look a happy man.”</p>

<p>“He is not happy.”</p>

<p>“You know something about him—more than we
all know?” asked Louise, with keen curiosity.</p>

<p>“Not much. I met him at Nice before he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
into his property. He was not a very fortunate person
at that time, and he doesn’t care to be reminded
of it now.”</p>

<p>“Was he out-at-elbows, or in debt?”</p>

<p>“Neither. His troubles did not take that form.
But I am not a gossip. Let the past be past, as
Gœthe says. We can’t change it, and it is charity
to forget it. If we are not sure about what we touch
and hear and see—or fancy we hear and touch and
see—in the present, how much less can we be sure
of any reality or external existence in the past! It
is all done away with—vanished. How can we know
that it ever was? A grave here and there is the only
witness; and even the grave and the name on the
headstone may be only a projection of our own consciousness.
We are such stuff as dreams are made
of.”</p>

<p>“That is a politely circuitous manner of refusing
to tell me anything about Mr. Greswold when his
name was Ransome. No matter. I shall find other
people who know the scandal, I have no doubt.
Your prevarication assures me that there was a
scandal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>This was on the eve of the concert at Enderby,
at about the same hour when George Greswold
showed Mildred his first wife’s portrait. Castellani
and his hostess were alone together in the lady’s
morning-room, while Hillersdon and his other
guests were in the billiard-room on the opposite side
of a broad corridor. Mrs. Hillersdon had a way of
turning over her visitors to her husband when they
bored her. Gusts of loud talk and louder laughter
came across the corridor now and again as they
played pool. There were times when Louise was too
tired of life to endure the burden of commonplace
society. She liked to dream over a novel. She
liked to talk with a clever young man like Castellani.
His flatteries amused her, and brought back a faint
flavour of youth and a dim remembrance of the day
when all men praised her, when she had known herself
without a rival. Now other women were beautiful,
and she was only a tradition. She had toiled
hard to live down her past, to make the world forget
that she had ever been Louise Lorraine: yet there
were moments in which she felt angry to find that
old personality of hers so utterly forgotten, when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
was tempted to cry out, “What rubbish you talk
about your Mrs. Egremont, your Mrs. Linley Varden,
your professional beauties and fine lady actresses.
Have you never heard of <span class="allsmcap">ME</span>—Louise Lorraine?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The drawing-rooms at Enderby Manor had
been so transformed under Mr. Castellani’s superintendence,
and with the help of his own dexterous
hands, that there was a unanimous expression of
surprise from the county families as they entered that
region of subdued light and æsthetic draperies between
three and half-past three o’clock on the afternoon
of the concert.</p>

<p>The Broadwood grand stood on a platform in
front of a large bay-window, draped as no other hand
could drape a piano, with embroidered Persian curtains
and many-hued Algerian stuffs, striped with
gold; and against the sweeping folds of drapery rose
a group of tall golden lilies out of a shallow yellow
vase. A cluster of gloxinias were massed near the
end of the piano, and a few of the most artistic chairs
in the house were placed about for the performers.
The platform, instead of being as other platforms, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
a straight line across one side of the room, was
placed diagonally, so as to present the picturesque
effect of an angle in the background, an angle lighted
with clusters of wax-candles, against a forest of
palms.</p>

<p>All the windows had been darkened save those in
the further drawing-room, which opened into the
garden, and even these were shaded by Spanish
hoods, letting in coolness and the scent of flowers,
with but little daylight. Thus the only bright light
was on the platform.</p>

<p>The auditorium was arranged with a certain artistic
carelessness: the chairs in curved lines to accommodate
the diagonal line of the platform; and this
fact, in conjunction with the prettiness of the stage,
put every one in good temper before the concert
began.</p>

<p>The concert was as other concerts: clever amateur
singing, excellent amateur playing, fine voices cultivated
to a certain point, and stopping just short of
perfect training.</p>

<p>César Castellani’s three little songs—words by
Heine—music, Schubert and Jensen—were the hit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the afternoon. There were few eyes that were unclouded
by tears, even among those listeners to whom
the words were in an unknown language. The pathos
was in the voice of the singer.</p>

<p>The duet was performed with <em>aplomb</em>, and elicited
an encore, on which Pamela and Castellani sang the
old-fashioned “Flow on, thou shining river,” which
pleased elderly people, moving them like a reminiscence
of long-vanished youth.</p>

<p>Pamela’s heart beat furiously as she heard the
applause, and she curtsied herself off the platform in
a whirl of delight. She felt that it was in her to be
a great public singer—a second Patti—if—if she
could be taught and trained by Castellani. Her head
was full of vague ideas—a life devoted to music—three
years’ hard study in Italy—a <em>début</em> at La Scala—a
world-wide renown achieved in a single night. She
even wondered how to Italianise her name. Ransomini?
No, that would hardly do. Pamelani—Pameletta?
What awkward names they were—christian
and surname both!</p>

<p>And then, crimsoning at the mere thought, she
saw in large letters, “<span class="smcap">Madame Castellani</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>How much easier to make a great name in the
operatic world with a husband to fight one’s battles
and get the better of managers!</p>

<p>“With an income of one’s own it ought to be
easy to make one’s way,” thought Pamela, as she
stood behind the long table in the dining-room, dispensing
tea and coffee, with the assistance of maids
and footmen.</p>

<p>Her head was so full of these bewildering visions
that she was a little less on the alert than she ought
to have been for shillings and half-crowns, whereby
a few elderly ladies got their tea and coffee for nothing,
not being asked for payment, and preferring
to consider the entertainment gratis.</p>

<p>Mildred’s part of the concert was performed to
perfection—not a false note in an accompaniment, or
a fault in the <em>tempo</em>. Lady Millborough, a very
exacting personage, declared she had never been so
well supported in her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval de bataille</i>, the finale to
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Cenerentola</i>. But many among the audience remarked
that they had never seen Mrs. Greswold look
so ill; and both Rollinson and Castellani were seriously
concerned about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“You are as white as marble,” said the Italian.
“I know you are suffering.”</p>

<p>“I assure you it is nothing. I have not been
feeling very well lately, and I had a sleepless night.
There is nothing that need give any one the slightest
concern. You may be sure I shall not break
down. I am very much interested in the painted
window,” she added, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“It is not that I fear,” said Castellani, in a lower
voice. “It is of you and your suffering I am
thinking.”</p>

<p>George Greswold did not appear at the concert:
he was engaged elsewhere.</p>

<p>“I cannot think how Uncle George allowed
himself to have an appointment at Salisbury this
afternoon,” said Pamela. “I know he doats on
music.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he doesn’t doat upon it quite so well
as to like to see his house turned topsy-turvy,” said
Lady Millborough, who would have allowed every
philanthropic scheme in the country to collapse for
want of cash rather than suffer her drawing-room to
be pulled about by amateur scene-shifters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hillersdon and her party occupied a prominent
position near the platform; but that lady was
too clever to make herself conspicuous. She talked
to the people who were disposed to friendliness—their
numbers had increased with the advancing years—and
she placidly ignored those who still held themselves
aloof from “that horrid woman.” Nor did
she in any way appropriate Castellani as her special
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> when the people round her were praising him.
She took everything that happened with the repose
which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere, and may
often be found among women whom the Vere de
Veres despise.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>All was over: the last of the carriages had rolled
away. Castellani had been carried off in Mrs. Hillersdon’s
barouche, no one inviting him to stay at
the Manor House. Rollinson lingered to repeat his
effusive thanks for Mrs. Greswold’s help.</p>

<p>“It has been a glorious success,” he exclaimed;
“glorious! Who would have thought there was so
much amateur talent available within thirty miles?
And Castellani was a grand acquisition. We shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
clear at least seventy pounds for the window. I don’t
know how I can ever thank you enough for giving
us the use of your lovely rooms, Mrs. Greswold, and
for letting us pull them about as we liked.”</p>

<p>“That did not matter—much,” Mildred said
faintly, as she stood by the drawing-room door in the
evening light, the curate lingering to reiterate the
assurance of his gratitude. “Everything can be
arranged again—easily.”</p>

<p>She was thinking, with a dull aching at her heart,
that to her the pulling about and disarrangement of
those familiar rooms hardly mattered at all. They
were her rooms no longer. Enderby was never more
to be her home. It had been her happy home for
thirteen gracious years—years clouded with but one
natural sorrow, in the loss of her beloved father.
And now that father’s ghost rose up before her, and
said, “The sins of the fathers shall be visited upon
the children, and because of my sin you must go forth
from your happy home and forsake the husband of
your heart.”</p>

<p>She gave the curate an icy hand, and turned from
him without another word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Poor soul, she is dead-beat!” thought Rollinson,
as he trudged home to his lodgings over a joiner and
builder’s shop: airy and comfortable rooms enough,
but odorous of sawdust, and a little too near the
noises of the workshop.</p>

<p>He could but think it odd that he had not been
asked to dine at the Manor, as he would have been
in the ordinary course of events. He had told the
builder’s wife that he should most likely dine out,
whereupon that friendly soul had answered, “Why,
of course they’ll ask you, Mr. Rollinson. You know
they’re always glad to see you.”</p>

<p>And now he had to return to solitude and a fresh-killed
chop.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was seven o’clock, and George Greswold had
not yet come home from Salisbury. Very few words
had passed between him and his wife since she fell
fainting at his feet last night. He had summoned
her maid, and between them they had brought her
back to consciousness, and half carried her to her
room. She would give no explanation of her fainting-fit
when the maid had left the room, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
was lying on her bed, white and calm, with her
husband sitting by her side. She told him that
she was tired, and that a sudden giddiness had
come upon her. That was all he could get from
her.</p>

<p>“If you will ask me no questions, and leave me
quite alone, I will try to sleep, so that I may be fit
for my work in the concert to-morrow,” she pleaded.
“I would not disappoint them for worlds.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need be over-anxious about
them,” said her husband bitterly. “There is more
at stake than a painted window: there is your peace
and mine. Answer me only one question,” he said,
with intensity of purpose: “had your fainting-fit
anything to do with the portrait of my first wife?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you everything—after the concert to-morrow,”
she answered; “for God’s sake leave me
to myself till then.”</p>

<p>“Let it be as you will,” he answered, rising suddenly,
wounded by her reticence.</p>

<p>He left the room without another word. She
sprang up from her bed directly he was gone, ran to
the door and locked it, and then flung herself on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
knees upon the prie-dieu chair at the foot of a large
ivory crucifix which hung in a deep recess beside the
old-fashioned fireplace.</p>

<p>Here she knelt, in tears and prayer, deep into
the night. Then for an hour or more she walked up
and down the room, absorbed in thought, by the dim
light of the night-lamp.</p>

<p>When the morning light came she went to a
bookcase in a little closet of a room opening out of
the spacious old bedroom—a case containing only
devotional books, and of these she took out volume
after volume—Taylor’s <cite>Rule of Conscience</cite>, Hooker’s
<cite>Religious Polity</cite>, Butler, Paley—one after another,
turning over the leaves, looking through the indexes—searching
for something which she seemed unable
to find anywhere.</p>

<p>“What need have I to see what others have
thought?” she said to herself at last, after repeated
failure; “Clement Cancellor knows the right. I could
have no better guide than his opinion, and he has
spoken. What other law do I need? His law is the
law of God.”</p>

<p>Not once did her eyes close in sleep all through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
that night, or in the morning hours before breakfast.
She made an excuse for breakfasting in her
dressing-room, a large, airy apartment, half boudoir.
She was told that Mr. Greswold had gone out early
to see some horses at Salisbury, and would not be
back till dinner-time. He was to be met at the station
at half-past seven.</p>

<p>She had her morning to herself. Pamela was
rehearsing her part in the duet, and in “Flow on,
thou shining river,” which was to be sung in the
event of an encore. That occupation, and the
arrangement of her toilet, occupied the young lady
till luncheon—allowing for half-hourly rushes about
the lawn and shrubberies with Box, whose health
required activity, and whose social instincts yearned
for companionship.</p>

<p>“He can’t get on with only Kassandra; she hasn’t
intellect enough for him,” said Pamela.</p>

<p>It was only ten minutes before the arrival of the
performers that Mrs. Greswold went down-stairs, pale
as ashes, but ready for the ordeal. She had put on
a white gown with a little scarlet ribbon about it, lest
black should make her pallor too conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>And now it was seven o’clock, and she was alone.
The curate had been right in pronouncing her dead-beat;
but she had some work before her yet. She
had been writing letters in the morning. Two of
these she now placed on the mantelpiece in her bedroom:
one addressed to her husband, the other to
Pamela.</p>

<p>She had a bag packed—not one of those formidable
dressing-bags which weigh fifteen to twenty
pounds—but a light Russia-leather bag, just large
enough to contain the essentials of the toilet. She
put on a neat little black bonnet and a travelling-cloak,
and took her bag and umbrella, and went
down to the hall. She had given orders that the
carriage should call for her before going to the station,
and she was at the door ready to step into it
when it came round.</p>

<p>She told the groom that she was to be put down
at Ivy Cottage, and was driven off unseen by the
household, who were all indulging in a prolonged
tea-drinking after the excitement of the concert.</p>

<p>Ivy Cottage was within five minutes’ walk of
Romsey Station: a little red cottage, newly built,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
with three or four ivy plants languishing upon a
slack-baked brick wall, and just enough garden for
the proverbial cat to disport himself in at his ease—the
swinging of cats being no longer a popular
English sport. There was nothing strange in Mrs.
Greswold alighting at Ivy Cottage—unless it were
the hour of her visit—for the small brick box was
occupied by two maiden ladies of small means: one
a confirmed invalid; the other her patient nurse;
whom the lady of Enderby Manor often visited, and
in whom she was known to be warmly interested.</p>

<p>The coachman concluded that his mistress was
going to spend a quarter of an hour with the two
old ladies, while he went on and waited for his
master at the station, and that he was to call for
her on his return. He did not even ask for her
orders upon this point, taking them for granted.</p>

<p>He was ten minutes too soon at the station, as
every well-conducted coachman ought to be.</p>

<p>“I’m to call for my mistress, sir,” he said, as
Mr. Greswold stepped into the brougham.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At Ivy Cottage, sir: Miss Fisher’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Very good.”</p>

<p>The brougham pulled up at Ivy Cottage; and
the groom got down and knocked a resounding peal
upon the Queen Anne knocker, it being hardly possible
nowadays to find a knocker that is not after
the style of Queen Anne, or a newly-built twenty-five
pound a year cottage in any part of rural England
that does not offer a faint reminiscence of
Bedford Park.</p>

<p>The groom made his inquiry of the startled little
maid-of-all-work, fourteen years old last birthday,
and already aspiring to better herself as a vegetable-maid
in a nobleman’s family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greswold had not been at Ivy Cottage that
evening.</p>

<p>George Greswold was out of the brougham by
this time, hearing the girl’s answer.</p>

<p>“Stop where you are,” he said to the coachman,
and ran back to the station, an evil augury in his
mind.</p>

<p>He went to the up-platform, the platform at
which he had alighted ten minutes before.</p>

<p>“Did you see Mrs. Greswold here just now?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
asked the station-master, with as natural an air as
he could command.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. She got into the up-train, sir; the
train by which you came. She came out of the
waiting-room, sir, the minute after you left the platform.
You must just have missed her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have just missed her.”</p>

<p>He walked up and down the length of the platform
two or three times in the thickening dusk.
Yes, he had missed her. She had left him. Such
a departure could mean only severance—some deep
wound—which it might take long to heal. It
would all come right by and by. There could be
no such thing as parting between man and wife
who loved each other as they loved—who were
incapable of falsehood or wrong.</p>

<p>What was this jealous fancy that had taken
possession of her? This unappeasable jealousy of
the dead past—a passion so strong that it had
prompted her to rush away from him in this clandestine
fashion, to torture him by all the evidences
of an inconsolable grief. His heart was sick to
death as he went back to the carriage, helpless to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
do anything except go to his deserted home, and see
what explanation awaited him there.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight when the carriage drove
up to the Manor House. Pamela ran out into the
hall to receive him.</p>

<p>“How late you are, uncle!” she cried, “and I
can’t find aunt. Everything is at sixes and sevens.
The concert was a stupendous success—and—only
think!—<em>I</em> was encored.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, dear!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my duet with him: and then we sang the
other. They would have liked a third, only we pretended
not to understand. It would have made all
the others so fearfully savage if we had taken it.”</p>

<p>This speech was not a model of lucidity, but it
might have been much clearer and yet unintelligible
to George Greswold.</p>

<p>“Do you mind dining alone to-night, my dear
Pamela?” he said, trying to speak cheerily. “Your
aunt is out—and I—I have some letters to write—and
I lunched heavily at Salisbury.”</p>

<p>His heavy luncheon had consisted of a biscuit
and a glass of beer at the station. His important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
business had been a long ramble on Salisbury Plain,
alone with his troubled thoughts.</p>

<p>“Did your mistress leave any message for me?”
he asked the butler.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Nobody saw my mistress go out.
When Louisa went up to dress her for dinner she
was gone, sir—but Louisa said there was a letter
for you on the bedroom mantelpiece. Shall I send
for it, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, no—I will go myself. Serve dinner at
once. Miss Ransome will dine alone.”</p>

<p>George Greswold went to the bedroom—that fine
old room, the real Queen Anne room, with thick
walls and deep-set windows, and old window-seats,
and capacious recesses on each side of the high oak
chimneypiece, and richly-moulded wainscot, and
massive panelled doors, a sober eighteenth-century
atmosphere in which it is a privilege to exist—a
spacious old room, with old Dutch furniture, of the
pre-Chippendale era, and early English china, Worcester
simulating Oriental, Chelsea striving after
Dresden: a glorious old room, solemn and mysterious
as a church in the dim light of a pair of wax-candles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
which Louisa the maid had lighted on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>There, between the candles, appeared two letters:
“George Greswold, Esq.,” “Miss Ransome.”</p>

<p>The husband’s letter was a thick one, and the
style of the penmanship showed how the pen had
hurried along, driven by the electric forces of
excitement and despair:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Beloved</span>,—You asked me last night if the
photograph which you showed me had anything to
do with my fainting-fit. It had everything to do
with it. That photograph is a portrait of my unhappy
sister, my cruelly-used, unacknowledged
sister; and I, who have been your wife fourteen
years, know now that our marriage was against the
law of God and man—that I have never been legally
your wife—that our union from the first has been
an unholy union, and for that unlawful marriage the
hand of God has been laid upon us—heavily—heavily—in
chastisement, and the darling of our
hearts has been taken from us.</p>

<p>“‘Whom He loveth He chasteneth.’ He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
chastened us, George—perhaps to draw us nearer
to Him. We were too happy, it may be, in this
temporal life—too much absorbed by our own
happiness, living in a charmed circle of love and
gladness, till that awful chastisement came.</p>

<p>“There is but one course possible to me, my
dear and honoured husband, and that course lies
in life-long separation. I am running away from
my dear home like a criminal, because I am not
strong enough to stand face to face with you and tell
you what must be. We must do our best to live
out our lives asunder, George; we must never meet
again as wedded lovers, such as we have been for
fourteen years. God knows, my affection for you
has grown and strengthened with every year of
union, and yet it seems to me on looking back that
my heart went out to you in all the fulness of an
infinite love when first we stood, hand clasped in
hand, beside the river. If you are angry with me,
George—if you harden your heart against me because
I do that which I know to be my duty, at least
believe that I never loved you better than in this
bitter hour of parting. I spent last night in prayer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
and thought. If there were any way of escape—any
possibility of living my own old happy life with
a clear conscience—I think God would have shown it
to me in answer to my prayers; but there was no
ray of light, no gleam of hope. Conscience answers
sternly and plainly. By the law of God I have never
been your wife, and His law commands me to
break an unhallowed tie, although my heart may
break with it.</p>

<p>“Do you remember your argument with Mr.
Cancellor? I never saw you so vehement in any
such dispute, and you took the side which I can
but think the side of the Evil One. That conversation
now seems to me like a strange foreshadowing
of sorrow—a lesson meant for my guidance. Little
did I then think that this question could ever have
any bearing on my own life; but I recall every
word now, and I remember how earnestly my old
master spoke—how ruthlessly he maintained the
right. Can I doubt his wisdom, from whose lips
I first learnt the Christian law, and in whom I first
saw the true Christian life?</p>

<p>“I have written to Pamela, begging her to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
with you, to take my place in the household, and to
be to you as an adopted daughter. May God be
merciful to us both in this heavy trial, George! Be
sure He will deal with us mercifully if we do our
duty according to the light that is given to us.</p>

<p>“I shall stay to-night in Queen Anne’s Gate
with Mrs. Tomkison. Please send Louisa to me
to-morrow with luggage for a considerable absence
from home. She will know what to bring. You
can tell her that I am going abroad for my health.
My intention is to go to some small watering-place
in Germany, where I can vegetate, away from all
beaten tracks, and from the people who know us.
You may rely upon me to bear my own burden, and
to seek sympathy and consolation from no earthly
comforter.</p>

<p>“Do not follow me, George—should your heart
urge you to do so. Respect my solemn resolution,
the result of many prayers.—Your ever loving</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">George Greswold</span> read his wife’s letter a second
time with increasing perplexity and trouble of mind.
Her sister! What could this mean? She had
never told him of the existence of a sister. She had
been described by her father, by every one, as an only
child. She had inherited the whole of her father’s
fortune.</p>

<p>“Her cruelly-used, unacknowledged sister.”</p>

<p>Those words indicated a social mystery, and as
he read and re-read those opening lines of his wife’s
letter he remembered her reticence about that girl-companion
from whom she had been parted so early.
He remembered her blushing embarrassment when
he questioned her about the girl she called Fay.</p>

<p>The girl had been sent to a finishing-school at
Brussels, and Mildred had seen her no more.</p>

<p>His first wife had finished her education at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Brussels. She had talked to him often of the fashionable
boarding-school in the quaint old street near
the Cathedral; and the slights she had endured
there from other girls because of her isolation.
There was no stint in the expense of her education.
She had as many masters as she cared to have. She
was as well dressed as the richest of her companions.
But she was nobody, and belonged to nobody, could
give no account of herself that would satisfy those
merciless inquisitors.</p>

<p>His wife, Vivien Faux, the young English lady
whom he had met at Florence. She was travelling
in the care of an English artist and his wife, who
spent their lives on the Continent. She submitted to
no authority, had ample means, and was thoroughly
independent. She did not get on very well with
either the artist or his wife. She had a knack of
saying disagreeable things, and a tongue of exceeding
bitterness. A difficult subject the painter called
her, and imparted to his particular friends in confidence
that his wife and Miss Faux were always
quarrelling. Vivien Faux, that was the name borne
by the girl whom he met nineteen years ago at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
an evening-party in Florence; that was the name
of the girl he had married, after briefest acquaintance,
knowing no more about her than that she had a
fortune of thirty thousand pounds when she came of
age, and that the trustee and custodian of that fortune
was a lawyer in Lincoln’s Inn, who affected no
authority over her, and put no difficulties in the way
of her marrying.</p>

<p>He remembered now when he first saw Mildred
Fausset something in her fresh young beauty, some
indefinable peculiarity of expression or contour, had
evolved the image of his dead wife, that image which
never recurred to him without keenest pain. He
remembered how strange that vague, indescribable
resemblance had seemed to him, and how he had
asked himself if it had any real existence, or were
only the outcome of his own troubled mind, reverting
involuntarily to an agonising memory.</p>

<p>“Her face may come back to me in the faces of
other women, as it comes back to me in my miserable
dreams,” he told himself.</p>

<p>But as the years went by he became convinced that
the likeness was not imaginary. There were points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of resemblance—the delicate tracing of the eyebrows,
the form of the brow, the way the hair grew above
the temples, were curiously alike. He came to accept
the likeness as one of those chance resemblances
which are common enough in life. It suggested to
him nothing more than that.</p>

<p>He went to the library with the letter still in his
hand. His lamp was ready lighted, and, the September
evening being chilly, there was a wood fire
on the low hearth, which gave an air of cheerfulness
to the sombre room.</p>

<p>He rang and told the footman to send Mrs. Bell
to him.</p>

<p>Bell appeared, erect and severe of aspect as she
had been four-and-twenty years before; neatly dressed
in black silk, with braided gray hair, and a white
lace cap.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mrs. Bell, I have a good many questions
to ask you,” said Greswold, motioning her to
a chair on the further side of his desk.</p>

<p>He was sitting with his eyes fixed, looking at the
spot where Mildred had fallen senseless at his feet.
He sat for some moments in a reverie, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
turned suddenly, unlocked his desk, and took out
the photograph which he had shown Mildred last
night.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see that face before, Bell?” he
asked, handing her the open case.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, sir, yes, indeed, I should think
I did! but Miss Fay was younger than that when
she came to Parchment Street.”</p>

<p>“Did you see much of her in Parchment
Street?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a good deal, and at The Hook, too; a
good deal more than I wanted to. <em>I</em> didn’t hold
with her being brought into our house, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it was fair to my mistress.”</p>

<p>“But how was it unfair?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, <em>I</em> don’t wish to say anything against
the dead, and Mr. Fausset was a liberal master to
me, and I make no doubt that he died a penitent
man. He was a regular church-goer, and an upright
man in all his ways while <em>I</em> lived with him;
but right is right; and <em>I</em> shall always maintain that
it was a cruel thing to a young wife like Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Fausset, who doted on the ground he walked upon,
to bring his natural daughter into the house.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bell, do you know that this is a serious
accusation you are bringing against a dead man?”
said George Greswold solemnly. “Now, what
grounds have you for saying that this girl”—with
his hand upon the photograph—“was Mr. Fausset’s
daughter?”</p>

<p>“What grounds, sir? <em>I</em> don’t want any grounds.
I’m not a lawyer to put things in that way; but I
know what I know. First and foremost, she was the
image of him; and next, why did he bring her home
and want her to be made one of the family, and
treated as a sister by Miss Mildred?”</p>

<p>“She may have been the daughter of a
friend.”</p>

<p>“People don’t do that kind of thing—don’t run
the risk of making a wife miserable to oblige a friend,”
retorted Bell scornfully. “Besides, I say again, if
she wasn’t his own flesh and blood, why was she so
like him?”</p>

<p>“She may have been the daughter of a near relation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“He had but one near relation in the world: his
only sister, a young lady who was so difficult to
please that she refused no end of good offers, and of
such a pious turn that she has devoted her life to
doing good for the last five-and-twenty years, to my
certain knowledge. I hope, sir, you would not
insinuate that <em>she</em> had a natural daughter?”</p>

<p>“She may have made a secret marriage, perhaps,
known only to her brother.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t have done any such thing without
my knowledge, sir. She was a girl at school at the
time of Miss Fay’s birth. Don’t mix Miss Fausset
up in it, pray, sir.”</p>

<p>“Was it you only who suspected Mr. Fausset to
be Miss Fay’s father?”</p>

<p>“Only me, sir? Why, it was everybody: and,
what was worst of all, my poor mistress knew it,
and fretted over it to her dying day.”</p>

<p>“But you never heard Mr. Fausset acknowledge
the parentage?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not to me; but I have no doubt he
acknowledged it to his poor dear lady. He was an
affectionate husband, and he must have been very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
much wrapped up in that girl, or he wouldn’t have
made his wife unhappy about her.”</p>

<p>With but the slightest encouragement from Mr.
Greswold, Bell expatiated on the subject of Fay’s
residence in the two houses, and the misery she had
wrought there. She unconsciously exaggerated the
general conviction about the master’s relationship
to his <em>protégée</em>, nor did she hint that it was she who
first mooted the notion in the Parchment Street
household. She left George Greswold with the
belief that this relationship had been known for a
fact to a great many people—that the tie between
protector and protected was an open secret.</p>

<p>She dwelt much upon the child Mildred’s love for
the elder girl, which she seemed to think in itself an
evidence of their sisterhood. She gave a graphic
account of Mildred’s illness, and described how Fay
had watched beside her bed night after night.</p>

<p>“I saw her sitting there in her nightgown many
a time when I went in the middle of the night to
see if Mildred was asleep. I never liked Miss Fay,
but justice is justice, and I must say, looking back
upon all things,” said Mrs. Bell, with a virtuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
air, “that there was no deception about her love for
Miss Mildred. I may have thought it put on then;
but looking back upon it now, I know that it was real.”</p>

<p>“I can quite understand that my wife must have
been very fond of such a companion—sister or no
sister—but she was so young that no doubt she soon
forgot her friend. Memory is not tenacious at seven
years old,” said Greswold, with an air of quiet
thoughtfulness, cutting the leaves of a new book
which had lain on his desk, the paper-knife marking
the page where he had thrown it down yesterday
afternoon.</p>

<p>“Indeed, she didn’t forget, sir. You must not
judge Miss Mildred by other girls of seven. She
was—she was like Miss Lola, sir”—Bell’s elderly
voice faltered here. “She was all love and thoughtfulness.
She doted on Miss Fay, and I never saw
such grief as she felt when she came back from the
sea-side and found her gone. It was done for the
best, and it was the only thing my mistress could do
with any regard for her own self-respect; but even I
felt very sorry Miss Fay had been sent away, when I
saw what a blow it was to Miss Mildred. She didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
get over it for years; and though she was a good
and dutiful daughter, I know that she and her mother
had words about Miss Fay more than once.”</p>

<p>“She was very fond of her, was she?” murmured
George Greswold, in an absent way, steadily cutting
the leaves of his book. “Very fond of her. And
you have no doubt in your own mind, Mrs. Bell, that
the two were sisters?”</p>

<p>“Not the least doubt, sir. I never had,” answered
Bell resolutely.</p>

<p>She waited for him to speak again, but he sat
silent, cutting his way slowly through the big volume,
without making one jagged edge, so steady was the
movement of the hand that grasped the paper-knife.
His eyes were bent upon the book; his face was in
shadow.</p>

<p>“Is that all, sir?” Bell asked at last, when she
had grown tired of his silence.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Bell, that will do. Good-night.”</p>

<p>When the door closed upon her, he flung the
book away from him, sprang to his feet, and began
to pace the room, up and down its length of forty
feet, from hearth to door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Sisters!—and so fond of each other!” he muttered.
“My God, this is fatality! In this, as in the death
of my child, I am helpless. The wanton neglect of
my servants cost me the idol of my heart. It was
not my fault—not mine—but I lost her. And now
I am again the victim of fatality—blind, impotent—groping
in the dark web—caught in the inexorable
net.”</p>

<p>He went back to his desk, and re-read Mildred’s
letter in the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>“She leaves me because our marriage is unholy
in her eyes,” he said to himself. “What will she
think when she knows all—as she must know, I
suppose, sooner or later? Sooner or later all things
are known, says one of the wise ones of the earth.
Sooner or later! She is on the track now. Sooner
or later she must know—everything.”</p>

<p>He flung himself into a low chair in front of the
hearth, and sat with his elbows on his knees staring
at the fire.</p>

<p>“If it were that question of legality only,” he
said to himself, “if it were a question of Church,
law, bigotry, prejudice, I should not fear the issue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
My love for her, and hers for me, ought to be
stronger than any such prejudice. It would need
but the first sharp pain of severance to bring
her back to me, my fond and faithful wife, willing
to submit her judgment to mine, willing to
believe, as I believe, that such marriages are just
and holy, such bonds pure and true, all over the
world, even though one country may allow and
another disallow, one colony tie the knot and another
loosen it. If it were <em>that</em> alone which parts us, I
should not fear. But it is the past, the spectral past,
which rises up to thrust us asunder. Her sister!
And they loved each other as David and Jonathan
loved, with the love whose inheritance is a life-long
regret.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE VERDICT OF HER CHURCH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was nearly eleven o’clock when Mrs. Greswold
arrived at Waterloo. There had been half-an-hour’s
delay at Bishopstoke, where she changed trains,
and the journey had seemed interminable to the
over-strained brain of that solitary traveller. Never
before had she so journeyed, never during the
fourteen years of her married life had she sat
behind an engine that was carrying her away from
her husband. No words could speak that agony of
severance, or express the gloom of the future—stretching
before her in one dead-level of desolation—which
was to be spent away from him.</p>

<p>“If I were a Roman Catholic I would go into a
convent to-morrow; I would lock myself for ever
from the outer world,” she thought, feeling that
the world could be nothing to her without her
husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>And then she began to ponder seriously upon
those sisterhoods in which the Anglican Church is
now almost as rich as the Roman. She thought of
those women with whom she had been occasionally
brought in contact, whom she had been able to help
sometimes with her purse and with her sympathy,
and she knew that when the hour came for her to
renounce the world there would be many homes
open to receive her, many a good work worthy of
her labour.</p>

<p>“I am not like those good women,” she thought;
“the prospect seems to me so dreary. I have loved
the world too well. I love it still, even after all
that I have lost.”</p>

<p>She had telegraphed to her friend Mrs.
Tomkison, and that lady was at the terminus, with
her neat little brougham, and with an enthusiastic
welcome.</p>

<p>“It is so sweet of you to come to me!” she
exclaimed; “but I hope it is not any worrying
business that has brought you up to town so
suddenly—papers to sign, or anything of that
kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Tomkison was literary and æsthetic, and
had the vaguest notions upon all business details.
She was an ardent champion of woman’s rights,
sent Mr. Tomkison off to the City every morning to
earn money for her milliners, decorators, fads, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i> of every kind, and reminded him every
evening of his intellectual inferiority. She had
an idea that women of property were inevitably
plundered by their husbands, and that it was one
of the conditions of their existence to be wheedled
into signing away their fortunes for the benefit of
spendthrift partners, she herself being in the impregnable
position of never having brought her
husband a sixpence.</p>

<p>“No, it is hardly a business matter, Cecilia. I
am only in town <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>. I am going to my
aunt at Brighton to-morrow. I knew you would
give me a night’s shelter; and it is much nicer to be
with you than to go to an hotel.”</p>

<p>The fact was, that of two evils Mildred had chosen
the lesser. She had shrunk from the idea of meeting
her lively friend, and being subjected to the
ordeal of that lady’s curiosity; but it had seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
still more terrible to her to enter a strange hotel at
night, and alone. She who had never travelled
alone, who had been so closely guarded by a
husband’s thoughtful love, felt herself helpless as a
child in that beginning of widowhood.</p>

<p>“I should have thought it simply detestable of
you if you had gone to an hotel,” protested Cecilia,
who affected strong language. “We can have a
delicious hour of confidential talk. I sent Adam to
bed before I came out. He is an excellent devoted
creature—has just made what <em>he</em> calls a pot of
money on Mexican Street Railways; but he is a
dreadful bore when one wants to be alone with one’s
dearest friend. I have ordered a cosy little supper—a
few natives, only just in, a brace of grouse, and
a bottle of the only champagne which smart people
will hear of nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry you troubled about supper,”
said Mildred, not at all curious about the latest
fashion in champagne. “I could not take anything,
unless it were a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>“But you must have dined early, or hurriedly, at
any rate. I hate that kind of dinner—everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
huddled over—and the carriage announced before
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i>. And so you’re going to
your aunt. Is she ill? Has she sent for you at a
moment’s notice? You will come into all her
money, no doubt; and I am told she is immensely
rich.”</p>

<p>“I have never thought about her money.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not, you lucky creature. It will be
sending coals to Newcastle in your case. Your
father left you so rich. I am told Miss Fausset
gives no end of money to her church people. She
has put in two painted windows at St. Edmund’s:
a magnificent rose window over the porch, and a
window in the south transept by Burne Jones—a
delicious design—St. Cecilia sitting at an organ,
with a cloud of cherubs. By the bye, talking of St.
Cecilia, how did you like my friend Castellani? He
wrote me a dear little note of gratitude for my
introduction, so I am sure you were very good
to him.”</p>

<p>“I could not dishonour any introduction of
yours; besides, Mr. Castellani’s grandfather and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
father had been friends. That was a link. He was
very obliging in helping us with an amateur concert.”</p>

<p>“How do you like him? But here we are at
home. You shall tell me more while we are at
supper.”</p>

<p>Mildred had to sit down to the oysters and
grouse, whether she would or not. The dining-room
was charming in the day-time, with its view
of the Park. At night it might have been a room
excavated from Vesuvian lava, so strictly classic
were its terra-cotta draperies, its butter-boat lamps,
and curule chairs.</p>

<p>“How sad to see you unable to eat anything!”
protested Mrs. Tomkison, snapping up the natives
with gusto; for it may be observed that the people
who wait up for travellers, or for friends coming
home from the play, are always hungrier than those
who so return. “You shall have your tea directly.”</p>

<p>Mildred had eaten nothing since her apology for
a breakfast. She was faint with fasting, but had no
appetite, and the odour of grouse, fried bread-crumbs,
and gravy sickened her. She withdrew to a chair
by the fire, and had a dainty little tea-table placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
at her side, while Mrs. Tomkison demolished one of
the birds, talking all the time.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a gifted creature?” she asked, helping
herself to the second half of the bird.</p>

<p>Mildred almost thought she was speaking of
the grouse.</p>

<p>“I mean Castellani,” said Cecilia, in answer to
her interrogative look. “Isn’t he a heap of talent?
You heard him play, of course, and you heard his
divine voice? When I think of his genius for music,
and remember that he wrote <em>that</em> book, I am actually
wonderstruck.”</p>

<p>“The book is clever, no doubt,” answered Mildred
thoughtfully, “almost too clever to be quite sincere.
And as for genius—well, I suppose his musical
talent does almost reach genius; and yet what more
can one say of Mozart, Beethoven, or Chopin? I
think genius is too large a word for any one less
than they.”</p>

<p>“But I say he is a genius,” cried Mrs. Tomkison,
elated by grouse and dry sherry (the champagne
had been put aside when Mildred refused it). “Does
he not carry one out of oneself by his playing? Does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
not his singing open the floodgates of our hard,
battered old hearts? No one ever interested me so
much.”</p>

<p>“Have you known him long?”</p>

<p>“For the last three seasons. He is with me three
or four times a week when he is in town. He is
like a son of the house.”</p>

<p>“And does Mr. Tomkison like him?”</p>

<p>“O, you know Adam,” said Cecilia, with an expressive
shrug. “You know Adam’s way. <em>He</em>
doesn’t mind. ‘You always must have somebody
hanging about you,’ he said, ‘so you may as well
have that French fool as any one else.’ Adam calls
all foreigners Frenchmen, if they are not obtrusively
German. Castellani has been devoted to me; and
I daresay I may have got myself talked about on
his account,” pursued Cecilia, with the pious resignation
of a blameless matron of five-and-forty, who
rather likes to be suspected of an intrigue; “but I
can’t help <em>that</em>. He is one of the few young men
I have ever met who understands me. And then
we are such near neighbours, and it is easy for him
to run in at any hour. ‘You ought to give him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
latchkey,’ says Adam; ‘it would save the servants a
lot of trouble.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember; he lives in Queen Anne’s
Mansions,” Mildred answered listlessly.</p>

<p>“He has a suite of rooms near the top, looking
over half London, and exquisitely furnished. He
gives afternoon tea to a few chosen friends who
don’t mind the lift; and we have had a Materialisation
in his rooms, but it wasn’t a particularly good
one,” added Mrs. Tomkison, as if she were talking
of something to eat.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The maid Louisa arrived at Queen Anne’s Gate
a little before luncheon on the following day. She
brought a considerable portion of Mrs. Greswold’s
belongings in two large basket-trunks, a portmanteau,
and a dressing-bag. These were at once sent
on to Victoria in the cab that had brought the young
person and the luggage from Waterloo, while the
young person herself was accommodated with dinner,
table-beer, and gossip in the housekeeper’s room.
She also brought a letter for her mistress, a letter
written by George Greswold late on the night before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Mildred could hardly tear open the envelope for
the trembling of her hands. How would he write
to her? Would he plead against her decision?
would he try to make her waver? Would he set love
against law, in such irresistible words as love alone
can use? She knew her own weakness and his
strength, and she opened his letter full of fear for
her own resolution: but there was no passionate
pleading.</p>

<p>The letter was measured almost to coldness:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I need not say that your departure, together
with your explanation of that departure, has come
upon me as a crushing blow. Your reasons in your
own mind are doubtless unanswerable. I cannot
even endeavour to gainsay them. I could only seem
to you as a special pleader, making the worse appear
the better reason, for my own selfish ends. You
know my opinion upon this hard-fought question of
marriage with a deceased wife’s sister; and you
know how widely it differs from Mr. Cancellor’s
view and yours—which, to my mind, is the view of
the bigot, and not the Christian. There is no word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
in Christ’s teaching to forbid such marriages. Your
friend and master, Clement Cancellor, is of the school
which sets the law-making of a mediæval Church above
the wisdom of Christ. Am I to lose my wife because
Mr. Cancellor is a better Christian than his Master?</p>

<p>“But granted that you are fixed in this way of
thinking, that you deem it your duty to break your
husband’s heart, and make his home desolate, rather
than tolerate the idea of union with one who was
once married to your half-sister, let me ask you at
least to consider whether you have sufficient ground
for believing that my first wife was verily your father’s
daughter. In the first place, your only evidence of
the identity between my wife and the girl you call
Fay consists of a photograph which bears a striking
likeness to the girl you knew, a likeness which I am
bound to say Bell saw as instantly as you yourself had
seen it. Remember, that the strongest resemblances
have been found between those who were of no kin
to each other; and that more than one judicial
murder has been committed on the strength of
just such a likeness.</p>

<p>“The main point at issue, however, is not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
much the question of identity as the question whether
the girl Fay was actually your father’s daughter; and
from my interrogation of Bell, it appears to me that
the evidence against your father in this matter is
one of impressions only, and, even as circumstantial
evidence, too feeble to establish any case against
the accused. Is it impossible for a man to be
interested in an orphan girl, and to be anxious to
establish her in his own home, as a companion for
his only child, unless that so-called orphan were his
own daughter, the offspring of a hidden intrigue?
There may be stronger evidence as to Fay’s parentage
than the suspicions of servants or your mother’s
jealousy; but as yet I have arrived at none. You
possibly may know much more than Bell knows,
more than your letter implies. If it is not so, if
you are acting on casual suspicions only, I can but
say that you are prompt to strike a man whose heart
has been sorely tried of late, and who had a special
claim upon your tenderness by reason of that recent
loss.</p>

<p>“I can write no more, Mildred. My heart is
too heavy for many words. I do not reproach you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
I only ask you to consider what you are doing
before you make our parting irrevocable. You have
entreated me not to follow you, and I will obey you,
so far as to give you time for reflection before I
force myself upon your presence; but I must see
you before you leave England. I ask no answer to
this letter until we meet.—Your unhappy husband</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 1em">George Greswold.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The letter chilled her by its calm logic—its
absence of passion. There seemed very little of the
lover left in a husband who could so write. His
contempt for a law which to her was sacred shocked
her almost as if it had been an open declaration of
infidelity. His sneer at Clement Cancellor wounded
her to the quick.</p>

<p>She answered her husband’s letter immediately:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Alas! my beloved,” she wrote, “my reason for
believing Fay to have been my sister is unanswerable.
My mother on her death-bed told me of the
relationship; told me the sad secret with bitter
tears. Her knowledge of that story had cast a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
shadow on the latter years of her married life. I
had seen her unhappy, without knowing the cause.
On her death-bed she confided in me. I was almost
a woman then, and old enough to understand what
she told me. Women are so jealous where they
love, George. I suffered many a sharp pang after
my discovery of your previous marriage; jealous of
that unknown rival who had gone before me, little
dreaming that fatal marriage was to cancel my own.</p>

<p>“My mother’s evidence is indisputable. She
must have known. As I grew older I saw
that there was that in my father’s manner when
Fay was mentioned which indicated some painful
secret. The time came when I was careful to avoid
the slightest allusion to my lost sister; but in my
own mind and in my own heart I cherished her
image as the image of a sister.</p>

<p>“I am grieved that you should despise Mr. Cancellor
and his opinions. My religious education was
derived entirely from him. My father and mother
were both careless, though neither was unbelieving.
He taught me to care for spiritual things. He
taught me to look to a better life than the best we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
can lead here; and in this dark hour I thank and
bless him for having so taught me. What should
I be now, adrift on a sea of trouble, without the
compass of faith? I will steer by that, George,
even though it carry me away from him I shall
always devotedly love.—Ever, in severance as in
union, your own</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 1em">Mildred.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>She had written to Mr. Cancellor early that
morning, asking him to call upon her before three
o’clock. He was announced a few minutes after she
finished her letter, and she went to the drawing-room
to receive him.</p>

<p>His rusty black coat and slouched hat, crumpled
carelessly in his ungloved hand, looked curiously out
of harmony with Mrs. Tomkison’s drawing-room,
which was the passion of her life, the shrine to which
she carried gold and frankincense and myrrh,
in the shape of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rose du Barri</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bleue du Roi</i>
Sèvres, veritable old Sherraton tables and chairs, and
commodes and cabinets from the boudoir of Marie
Antoinette, a lady who must assuredly have sat at
more tables and written at more escritoires than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
other woman in the world. Give her Majesty only
five minutes for every table and ten for every <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonheur
du jour</i> attributed to her possession, and her married
life must have been a good deal longer than the
span which she was granted of joy and grief between
the passing of the ring and the fall of the
axe.</p>

<p>Unsightly as that dark figure showed amidst the
delicate tertiaries of Lyons brocade and the bright
colouring of satin-wood tables and Sèvres porcelain,
Mr. Cancellor was perfectly at his ease in Mrs. Tomkison’s
drawing-room. He wasted very few of his
hours in such rooms, albeit there were many such
in which his presence was courted; but seldom as
he appeared amidst such surroundings he was never
disconcerted by them. He was not easily impressed
by externals. The filth and squalor of a London
slum troubled him no more than the artistic intricacies
of a West End drawing-room, in which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culte</i>
of beauty left him no room to put down his hat.
It was humanity for which he cared—persons, not
things. His soul went straight to the souls he was
anxious to save. He was narrow, perhaps; but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
that narrowness there was a concentrative power
that could work wonders.</p>

<p>One glance at Mildred’s face showed him that
she was distressed, and that her trouble was no small
thing. He held her hand in his long lean fingers,
and looked at her earnestly as he said:</p>

<p>“You have something to tell me—some sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “an incurable sorrow.”</p>

<p>She burst into tears, the first she had shed since
she left her home, and sobbed passionately for some
moments, leaning against the Trianon spinet, raining
her tears upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vernis Martin</i> in a way that
would have made Mrs. Tomkison’s blood run cold.</p>

<p>“How weak I am!” she said impatiently, as she
dried her eyes and choked back her sobs. “I thought
I was accustomed to my sorrow by this time. God
knows it is no new thing! It seems a century old
already.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, and tell me all about it,” said
Clement Cancellor quietly, drawing forward a chair
for her, and then seating himself by her side. “I
cannot help you till you have told me all your trouble;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and you know I shall help you if I can. I can sympathise
with you, in any case.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure of that,” she answered sadly;
and then, falteringly but clearly, she told him the
whole story, from its beginning in the days of her
childhood till the end yesterday. She held back
nothing, she spared no one. Freely, as to her father
confessor, she told all. “I have left him for ever,”
she concluded. “Have I done right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have done right. Anything less
than that would have been less than right. If you
are sure of your facts as to the relationship—if Mr.
Greswold’s first wife was your father’s daughter—there
was no other course open to you. There was
no alternative.”</p>

<p>“And my marriage is invalid in law?” questioned
Mildred.</p>

<p>“I do not think so. Law does not always mean
justice. If this young lady was your father’s natural
daughter she had no status in the eye of the law.
She was not your sister—she belonged to no one,
in the eye of the law. She had no right to bear
your father’s name. So, if you accept the civil law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
for your guide, you may still be George Greswold’s
wife—you may ignore the tie between you and his
first wife. Legally it has no existence.”</p>

<p>Mildred crimsoned, and then grew deadly pale.
In the eye of the law her marriage was valid. She
was not a dishonoured woman—a wife and no wife.
She might still stand by her husband’s side—go
down to the grave as his companion and sweetheart.
They who so short a time ago were wedded lovers
might be lovers again, all clouds dispersed, the
sunshine of domestic peace upon their pathway—if
she were content to be guided by the law.</p>

<p>“Should you think me justified if I were to
accept my legal position, and shut my eyes to all the
rest?” she asked, knowing but too well what the
answer would be.</p>

<p>“Should <em>I</em> so think! O Mildred, do you know
me so little that you need ask such a question?
When have I ever taken the law for my guide?
Have I not defied that law when it stood between
me and my faith? Am I not ready to defy it again
were the choice between conscience and law forced
upon me? To my mind your half-sister’s position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
makes not one jot of difference. She was not the
less your sister because of her parent’s sin, and your
marriage with the man who was her husband is not
the less an incestuous marriage.”</p>

<p>The word struck Mildred like a whip—stung the
wounded heart like the sharp cut of a lash.</p>

<p>“Not one word more,” she cried, holding up her
hands as if to ward off a blow. “If my union with
my—very dear—husband was a sinful union, I was
an unconscious sinner. The bond is broken for ever.
I shall sin no more.”</p>

<p>Her tears came again; but this time they
gathered slowly on the heavy lids, and rolled slowly
down the pale cheeks, while she sat with her eyes
fixed, looking straight before her, in dumb despair.</p>

<p>“Be sure all will be well with you if you cleave
to the right,” said the priest, with grave tenderness,
feeling for her as acutely as an ascetic can feel for
the grief that springs from earthly passions and
temporal loves, sympathising as a mother sympathises
with a child that sobs over a broken toy. The
toy is a futile thing, but to the child priceless.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with your life?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
asked gently, after a long pause, in which he had
given her time to recover her self-possession.</p>

<p>“I hardly know. I shall go to the Tyrol next
month, I think, and choose some out-of-the-way
nook, where I can live quietly; and then for the
winter I may go to Italy or the south of France. A
year hence perhaps I may enter a sisterhood; but I
do not want to take such a step hurriedly.”</p>

<p>“No, not hurriedly,” said Mr. Cancellor, his
face lighting up suddenly as that pale, thin, irregular-featured
face could lighten with the divine radiance
from within; “not hurriedly, not too soon;
but I feel assured that it would be a good thing for
you to do—the sovereign cure for a broken life.
You think now that happiness would be impossible
for you, anywhere, anyhow. Believe me, my dear
Mildred, you would find it in doing good to others.
A vulgar remedy, an old woman’s recipe, perhaps,
but infallible. A life lived for the good of others is
always a happy life. You know the glory of the sky
at sunset—there is nothing like it, no such splendour,
no such beauty—and yet it is only a reflected
light. So it is with the human heart, Mildred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
The sun of individual love has sunk below life’s
horizon, but the reflected glory of the Christian’s
love for sinners brightens that horizon with a far
lovelier light.”</p>

<p>“If I could feel like you; if I were as unselfish
as you—” faltered Mildred.</p>

<p>“You have seen Louise Hillersdon—a frivolous,
pleasure-loving woman, you think, perhaps; one
who was once an abject sinner, whom you are
tempted to despise. I have seen that woman kneeling
by the bed of death; I have seen her ministering
with unflinching courage to the sufferers from
the most loathsome diseases humanity knows; and
I firmly believe that those hours of unselfish love
have been the brightest spots in her chequered life.
Believe me, Mildred, self-sacrifice is the shortest
road to happiness. No, I would not urge you to
make your election hurriedly. Give yourself leisure
for thought and prayer, and then, if you decide on
devoting your life to good works, command my help,
my counsel—all that is mine to give.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know that I have a sure friend in
you, and that under heaven I have no better friend,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
she answered quietly, glancing at the clock as she
spoke. “I am going to Brighton this afternoon, to
spend a few days with my aunt, and to—tell her
what has happened. She must know all about Fay.
If there is any room for doubt she will tell me. My
last hope is there.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Miss Fausset</span>—Gertrude Fausset—occupied a large
house in Lewes Crescent—with windows commanding
all that there is of bold coast-line and open sea
within sight of Brighton. Her windows looked
eastward, and her large substantial mansion turned
its back upon all the frivolities of the popular watering-place—upon
its Cockney visitors of summer and
its November smartness, its aquarium and theatre,
its London stars and Pavilion concerts, its carriages
and horsemen—few of whom ever went so far east
as Lewes Crescent; its brazen bands and brazen
faces—upon everything except its church bells,
which were borne up to Miss Fausset’s windows by
every west wind, and which sounded with but little
intermission from no less than three tabernacles
within half a mile of the crescent.</p>

<p>Happily Miss Fausset loved the sound of church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
bells, loved all things connected with her own particular
church with the ardour which a woman who
has few ties of kindred or friendship can afford to
give to clerical matters. Nothing except serious
indisposition would have prevented her attending
matins at St. Edmund’s, the picturesque and semi-fashionable
Gothic temple in a narrow side street
within ten minutes’ walk of her house; nor was she
often absent from afternoon prayers, which were read
daily at five o’clock to a small and select congregation.
The somewhat stately figure of the elderly
spinster was familiar to most of the worshippers at
St. Edmund’s. All old Brightonians knew the history
of that tall, slim maiden lady, richly clad after
a style of her own, which succeeded in reconciling
Puritanism with the fashion of the day; very dignified
in her carriage and manners, with a touch of
hauteur, as of a miserable sinner who knew that she
belonged to the salt of the earth. Brightonians
knew that she was Miss Fausset, sole survivor of the
great house of Fausset &amp; Company, silk merchants
and manufacturers, St. Paul’s Churchyard and
Lyons; that she had inherited a handsome fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
from her father before she was twenty, that she had
refused a good many advantageous offers, had ranked
as a beauty, and had been much admired in her
time, that she had occupied the house in Lewes
Crescent for more than a quarter of a century, and
that she had taken a prominent part in philanthropic
associations and clerical matters during the greater
number of those years. No charity bazaar was considered
in the way of success until Miss Fausset
had promised to hold a stall; no new light in the
ecclesiastical firmament of Brighton ranked as
a veritable star until Miss Fausset had taken notice
of him. She received everybody connected with
Church and charitable matters. Afternoon tea in
her drawing-room was a social distinction, and
strangers were taken to her as to a Royal personage.
Her occasional dinners—very rare, and never large—were
talked of as perfection in the way of dining.</p>

<p>“It is easy for her to do things well,” sighed an
overweighted matron, “with her means, and no
family. She must be inordinately rich.”</p>

<p>“Did she come into a very large fortune at her
father’s death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“O, I believe old Fausset was almost a millionaire,
and he had only a son and a daughter. But it
is not so much the amount she inherited as the
amount she must have saved. Think how she must
have nursed her income, with her quiet way of
living! Only four indoor servants and a coachman;
no garden, and one fat brougham horse. She must
be rolling in money.”</p>

<p>“She gives away a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Nothing compared with what other people
spend. Money goes a long way in charity. Ten
pounds makes a good show on a subscription list;
but what is it in a butcher’s book? I daresay my
three boys have spent as much at Oxford in the last
six years as Miss Fausset has given in charity within
the same time; and <em>we</em> are poor people.”</p>

<p>It pleased Miss Fausset to live quietly, and to
spend very little money upon splendours of any
kind. There was distinction enough for her in the
intellectual ascendency she had acquired among
those church-going Brightonians who thought exactly
as she thought. Her spacious, well-appointed house;
her experienced servants—cook, housemaid, lady’s-maid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and butler; her neat little brougham and
perfect brougham horse realised all her desires in
the way of luxury. Her own diet was of an almost
ascetic simplicity, and her servants were on boardwages;
but she gave her visitors the best that the
season or the fashion could suggest to an experienced
cook. Even her afternoon tea was considered superior
to everybody else’s tea, and her table was provided
with daintier cakes and biscuits than were to be seen
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Her house had been decorated and furnished
under her own direction, and was marked in all
particulars by that grain of Puritanism which was
noticeable in the lady’s attire. The carpets and
curtains in the two drawing-rooms were silver-gray;
the furniture was French, and belonged to
the period of the Directory, when the graceful lightness
of the Louis Seize style was merging into
the classicism of the Empire. In Miss Fausset’s
drawing-room there were none of those charming
futilities which cumber the tables of more frivolous
women. Here Mr. Cancellor would have found
room, and to spare, for his hat—room for a committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
meeting, or a mission service, indeed—on
that ample expanse of silvery velvet pile, a small
arabesque pattern in different shades of gray.</p>

<p>The grand piano was the principal feature of the
larger room, but it was not draped or disguised,
sophisticated by flower-vases, or made glorious with
plush, after the manner of fashionable pianos. It
stood forth—a concert grand, in unsophisticated
bulk of richly carved rosewood, a Broadwood piano,
and nothing more. The inner room was lined with
bookshelves, and had the air of a room that was
meant for usefulness rather than hospitality. A
large, old-fashioned rosewood secrétaire, of the
Directory period, occupied the space at the side of
the wide single window, which commanded a view of
dead walls covered with Virginia creeper, and in the
distance a glimpse of the crocketed spire of St.
Edmund’s, a reproduction in little of one of the
turrets of the Sainte Chapelle.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the volumes in those tall bookcases
were of a theological character; the remaining third
consisted of those standard works which everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
likes to possess, but which only the superior few
care to read.</p>

<p>Mildred had telegraphed in the morning to
announce her visit, and she found her aunt’s confidential
man-servant, a German Swiss, and her aunt’s
neat little brougham waiting for her at the station.
Miss Fausset herself was in the inner drawing-room
ready to receive her.</p>

<p>There was something in the chastened colouring
and perfect order of that house in Lewes Crescent
which always chilled Mildred upon entering it after
a long interval. It was more than three years since
she had visited her aunt, and this afternoon in the
fading light the silver-gray drawing-rooms looked
colder and emptier than usual.</p>

<p>Miss Fausset rose to welcome her niece, and
imprinted a stately kiss on each cheek.</p>

<p>“My dear Mildred, you have given me a very
agreeable surprise,” she said; “but I hope it is no
family trouble that has brought you to me—so
suddenly.”</p>

<p>She looked at her niece searchingly with her
cold gray eyes. She was a handsome woman still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
at fifty-seven years of age. Her features were faultless,
and the oval of her face was nearly as perfect as
it had been at seven-and-twenty. Her abundant hair
was silvery gray, and worn <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> Marie Antoinette, a
style which lent dignity to her appearance. Her
dinner-gown of dark gray silk fitted her tall, upright
figure to perfection, and her one ornament, an
antique diamond cross, half hidden by the folds of
her lace fichu, was worthy of the rich Miss Fausset.</p>

<p>“Yes, aunt, it is trouble that has brought me
to you—very bitter trouble; but it is just possible
that you can help me to conquer it. I have come
to you for help, if you can give it.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, you must know I would do
anything in my power—” Miss Fausset began, with
gentle deliberation.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” Mildred answered, almost
impatiently. “I know that you will be sorry for
me, but you may not be able to do anything. It is
a forlorn hope. In such a strait as mine one
catches at any hope.”</p>

<p>Her aunt’s measured accents jarred upon her
overstrung nerves. Her grief raged within her like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
a fever, and the grave placidity of the elder woman
tortured her. There seemed no capacity for sympathy
in this stately spinster who stood and scanned
her with coldly inquisitive eyes.</p>

<p>“Can we be quite alone for a little while, aunt?
Are you sure of no one interrupting us while I am
telling you my troubles?”</p>

<p>“I will give an order. It is only half-past six,
and we do not dine till eight. There is no reason
we should be disturbed. Come and sit over here,
Mildred, on this sofa. Your maid can take your
hat and jacket to your room.”</p>

<p>Stray garments lying about in those orderly
drawing-rooms would have been agony to Miss
Fausset. She rang the bell, and told the servant to
send Mrs. Greswold’s maid, and to take particular
care that no visitor was admitted.</p>

<p>“I can see nobody this evening,” she said. “If
any one calls you will say I have my niece with me,
and cannot be disturbed.”</p>

<p>Franz, the Swiss butler, bowed with an air of
understanding the finest shades of feeling in that
honoured mistress. He brought out a tea-table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
and placed it conveniently near the sofa on which
Mildred was sitting, and he placed upon it the neatest
of salvers, with tiny silver teapot and Worcester
cup and saucer, and bread and butter such as Titania
herself might have eaten with an “apricock” or a
bunch of dewberries. Then he discreetly retired,
and sent Louisa, who smelt of tea and toast already,
though she could not have been more than ten
minutes in the great stony basement, which would
have accommodated a company of infantry just as
easily as the spinster’s small establishment.</p>

<p>Louisa took the jacket and hat and her mistress’s
keys, and withdrew to finish her tea and to discuss
the motive and meaning of this extraordinary
journey from Enderby to Brighton. The gossips
over the housekeeper’s tea-table inclined to the idea
that Mrs. Greswold had found a letter—a compromising
letter—addressed to her husband by some
lady with whom he had been carrying on an intrigue,
in all probability Mrs. Hillersdon of Riverdale.</p>

<p>“We all know who <em>she</em> was before Mr. Hillersdon
married her,” said Louisa; “and don’t tell me
that a woman who has behaved liked that while she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
was young would ever be really prudent. Mrs.
Hillersdon must be fifty if she’s a day; but she is a
handsome woman still, and who knows?—she may
have been an old flame of my master’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” sighed Franz assentingly. “It’s
generally an old flame that does the mischief. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wir
sind armer Thieren.</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“And now, my dear, tell me what has gone
wrong with you,” said Miss Fausset, seating herself
on the capacious sofa—low, broad, luxurious, one of
Crunden’s masterpieces—beside her niece.</p>

<p>The rooms were growing shadowy. A small fire
burned in the bright steel grate, and made the one
cheerful spot in the room, touching the rich bindings
of the books with gleams of light.</p>

<p>“O, it is a long story, aunt! I must begin at
the beginning. I have a question to ask you, and
your answer means life or death to me.”</p>

<p>“A question—to—ask—me?”</p>

<p>Miss Fausset uttered the words slowly, spacing
them out, one by one, in her clear, calm voice—the
voice that had spoken at committee meetings, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
had laid down the law in matters charitable and
ecclesiastical many times in that good town of
Brighton.</p>

<p>“I must go back to my childhood, aunt, in the
first place,” began Mildred, in her low, earnest voice,
her hands clasped, her eyes fixed upon her aunt’s
coldly correct profile, between her and the light
of the fire, the wide window behind her, with the
day gradually darkening after the autumnal sunset.
The three eastward-looking windows in the large
room beyond had a ghostly look, with their long
guipure curtains closely drawn against the dying
light.</p>

<p>“I must go back to the time when I was seven
years old, and my dear father,” falteringly, and with
tears in her voice, “brought home his adopted
daughter, Fay—Fay Fausset, he called her. She
was fourteen and I was only seven, but I was very
fond of her all the same. We took to each other
from the beginning. When we left London and
went to The Hook, Fay went with us. I was ill
there, and she helped to nurse me. She was very
good to me—kinder than I can say, and I loved her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
as if she had been my sister. But when I got well
she was sent away—sent to a finishing-school at
Brussels, and I never saw her again. She had only
lived with us one short summer. Yet it seemed as
if she and I had been together all my life. I missed
her sorely. I missed her for years afterwards.”</p>

<p>“My tender-hearted Mildred!” said Miss Fausset
gently. “It was like you to give your love to a
stranger, and to be so faithful to her memory!”</p>

<p>“O, but she was not a stranger! she was something
nearer and dearer. I could hardly have been
so fond of her if there had not been some link
between us.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Mildred! A warm-hearted child
will take to any one near her own age who is kind
to her. Why should this girl have been anything
more than an orphan, whom your father adopted out
of the generosity of his heart?”</p>

<p>“O, she was something more! There was a
mystery. Did you ever see her, aunt? I don’t
remember your coming to Parchment Street or to
The Hook while she was with us.”</p>

<p>“No. I was away from England part of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
year. I spent the autumn at Baden with my friends
the Templemores.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you knew nothing of the trouble
Fay made in our home—most innocently? It is
such a sad story, aunt. I can hardly bear to touch
upon it, even to you, for it cast a shadow upon my
father’s character. You know how I loved and honoured
him, and how it must pain me to say one
word that reflects upon him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you loved him. You could not
love him too well, Mildred. He was a good man—a
large-hearted, large-minded man.”</p>

<p>“And yet that one act of his, bringing poor Fay
into his home, brought unhappiness upon us all.
My mother seemed set against her from the very
first; and on her death-bed she told me that Fay
was my father’s daughter. She gave me no proof—she
told me nothing beyond that one cruel fact.
Fay was the offspring of hidden sin. She told me
this, and told me to remember it all my life. Do
you think, aunt, she was justified in this accusation
against my father?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell, Mildred?” Miss Fausset answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
coldly. “My brother may have had secrets
from me.”</p>

<p>“But did you never hear anything—any hint of
this mystery? Did you never know anything about
your brother’s life in the years before his marriage
which would serve as a clue? He could hardly have
cared for any one—been associated with any one—and
you not hear something—”</p>

<p>“If you mean did I ever hear that my brother
had a mistress, I can answer no,” replied Miss
Fausset, in a very unsympathetic voice. “But men
do not usually allow such things to be known to
their sisters, especially to a younger sister, as I was
by a good many years. He may have been—like
other men. Few of them seem free from the stain
of sin. But however that may have been, I know
nothing about the matter.”</p>

<p>“And you do not know the secret of Fay’s
parentage—you, my father’s only sister—his only
surviving relation. Can you help me to find any
one who knew more about his youth—any confidential
friend—any one who can tell me whether that
girl was really my sister?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“No, Mildred. I have no knowledge of your
father’s friends. They are all dead and gone, perhaps.
But what can it matter to you who this girl
was? She is dead. Let the secret of her existence
die with her. It is wisest, most charitable to do so.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you know she is dead!” cried Mildred
quickly. “Where and when did she die? How did
you hear of her?”</p>

<p>“From your father. She died abroad. I do
not remember the year.”</p>

<p>“Was it before my marriage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Long before?”</p>

<p>“Two or three years, perhaps. I cannot tell
you anything precisely. The matter was of no
moment to me.”</p>

<p>“O aunt, it is life and death to <em>me</em>. She was
my husband’s first wife. She and I—daughters of
one father—as I, alas! can but believe we were—married
the same man.”</p>

<p>“I never heard your husband was a widower.”</p>

<p>“No, nor did I know it until a few weeks ago;”
and then, as clearly as her distress of mind would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
allow, Mildred told how the discovery had been
made.</p>

<p>“The evidence of a photograph—which may be
a good or a bad likeness—is a small thing to go
upon, Mildred,” said her aunt. “I think you have
been very foolish to make up your mind upon such
evidence.”</p>

<p>“O, but there are other facts—coincidences!
And nothing would make me doubt the identity of
the original of that photograph with Fay Fausset.
I recognised it at the first glance; and Bell, who
saw it afterwards, knew the face immediately. There
could be no error in that. The only question is
about her parentage. I thought, if there were room
for doubt in the face of my mother’s death-bed statement,
you could help me. But it is all over. You
were my last hope,” said Mildred despairingly.</p>

<p>She let her face sink forward upon her clasped
hands. Only in this moment did she know how she
had clung to the hope that her aunt would be able
to assure her she was mistaken in her theory of
Fay’s parentage.</p>

<p>“My dear Mildred,” began Miss Fausset, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
a pause, “the words you have just used—‘death-bed
statement’—seem to mean something very solemn,
indisputable, irrevocable; but I must beg you to
remember that your poor mother was a very weak
woman and a very exacting wife. She was offended
with my brother for his adoption of an orphan girl.
I have heard her hold forth about her wrongs many
a time, vaguely, not daring to accuse him before
me; but still I could understand the drift of her
thoughts. She may have nursed these vague suspicions
of hers until they seemed to her like positive
facts; and on her death-bed, her brain enfeebled by
illness, she may have made direct assertions upon
no other ground than those long-cherished suspicions
and the silent jealousies of years. I do not
think, Mildred, you ought to take any decisive step
upon the evidence of your mother’s jealousy.”</p>

<p>“My mother spoke with conviction. She must
have known something—she must have had some
proof. But even if it were possible she could have
spoken so positively without any other ground than
jealous feeling, there are other facts that cry aloud
to me, evidences to which I dare not shut my eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
Fay must have belonged to some one, aunt,” pursued
Mildred, with growing earnestness, clasping her
hands upon Miss Fausset’s arm as they sat side by
side in the gathering darkness. “There must have
been some reason—and a strong one—for her presence
in our house. My father was not a man to
act upon caprice. I never remember any foolish or
frivolous act of his in all the years of my girlhood.
He was a man of thought and purpose; he did
nothing without a motive. He would not have
charged himself with the care of that poor girl unless
he had considered it his duty to protect her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“I am sure not. Then comes the question,
who was she if she was not my father’s daughter?
He had no near relations, he had no bosom friend
that I ever heard of—no friend so dear that he would
deem it his duty to adopt that friend’s orphan child.
There is no other clue to the mystery that I can
imagine. Can you, aunt, suggest any other solution?”</p>

<p>“No, Mildred, I cannot.”</p>

<p>“If there were no other evidence within my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
knowledge, my father’s manner alone would have
given me a clue to his secret. He so studiously
evaded my inquiries about Fay—there was such a
settled melancholy in his manner when he spoke of
her.”</p>

<p>“Poor John! he had a heart of gold, Mildred.
There never was a truer man than your father. Be
sure of that, come what may.”</p>

<p>“I have never doubted that.”</p>

<p>There was a pause of some minutes after this.
The two women sat in silence looking at the fire,
which had burned red and hollow since Franz had
last attended to it. Mildred sat with her head leaning
against her aunt’s shoulder, her hand clasping
her aunt’s hand. Miss Fausset sat erect as a dart,
looking steadily at the fire, her lips compressed and
resolute, the image of unfaltering purpose.</p>

<p>“And now, Mildred,” she began at last, in those
measured accents which Mildred remembered in her
childhood as an association of awe, “take an old
woman’s advice, and profit by an old woman’s experience
of life if you can. Put this suspicion of yours
on one side—forget it as if it had never been, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
go back to your good and faithful husband. This
suspicion of yours is but a suspicion at most, founded
on the jealous fancy of one of the most fanciful
women I ever knew. Why should George Greswold’s
life be made desolate because your mother was a
bundle of nerves? Forget all you have ever thought
about that orphan girl, and go back to your duty as
a wife.”</p>

<p>Mildred started away from her aunt, and left the
sofa as if she had suddenly discovered herself in
contact with the Evil One.</p>

<p>“Aunt, you astound, you horrify me!” she exclaimed.
“Can <em>you</em> be so false to the conduct and
principles of your whole life—can <em>you</em> put duty to a
husband before duty to God? Have I not sworn to
honour Him with all my heart, with all my strength;
and am I to yield to the weak counsel of my heart,
which would put my love of the creature above my
honour of the Creator? Would you counsel me to
persist in an unholy union—you whose life has been
given up to the service of God—you who have put
His service far above all earthly affections; you who
have shown yourself so strong: can you counsel me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
to be so weak: and to let my love—my fond true love
for my dear one—conquer my knowledge of the
right? Who knows if my darling’s death may not
have been God’s judgment upon iniquity—God’s
judgment—”</p>

<p>She had burst into sudden tears at the mention
of her husband’s name, with all that tenderness his
image evolved; but at that word judgment she
stopped abruptly with a half-hysterical cry, as a
vision of the past flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>She remembered the afternoon of the return to
Enderby, and how her husband had knelt by his
daughter’s grave, believing himself alone, and how
there had come up from that prostrate figure a bitter
cry:</p>

<p>“Judgment! judgment!”</p>

<p>Did he know? Was that the remorseful ejaculation
of one who knew himself a deliberate sinner?</p>

<p>Miss Fausset endured this storm of reproof without
a word. She never altered her attitude, or
wavered in her quiet contemplation of the fading
fire. She waited while Mildred paced up and down
the room in a tempest of passionate feeling, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
then she said, even more quietly than she had spoken
before,</p>

<p>“My dear Mildred, I have given you my advice,
conscientiously. If you refuse to be guided by the
wisdom of one who is your senior by a quarter of a
century, the consequences of your obstinacy must be
upon your own head. I only know that if <em>I</em> had as
good a man as George Greswold for my husband”—with
a little catch in her voice that sounded almost
like a sob—“it would take a great deal more than a
suspicion to part me from him. And now, Mildred,
if you mean to dress for dinner, it is time you went
to your room.”</p>

<p>In any other house, and with any other hostess,
Mildred would have asked to be excused from sitting
down to a formal dinner, and to spend the rest of
the evening in her own room; but she knew her
aunt’s dislike of any domestic irregularity, so she
went away meekly, and put on the black lace gown
which Louisa had laid out for her, and returned to
the drawing-room at five minutes before eight.</p>

<p>She had been absent half an hour, but it seemed
to her as if Miss Fausset had not stirred since she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
left her. The lamps were lighted, the fire had been
made up, and the silver-gray brocade curtains were
drawn; but the mistress of the house was sitting in
exactly the same attitude on the sofa near the fire,
erect, motionless, with her thoughtful gaze fixed
upon the burning coals in the bright steel grate.</p>

<p>Aunt and niece dined <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>, ministered to
by the experienced Franz, who was thorough master
of his calling. All the details of that quiet dinner
were of an elegant simplicity, but everything was
perfect after its fashion, from the soup to the dessert,
from the Irish damask to the old English silver—everything
such as befitted the station of a lady who
was often spoken of as the rich Miss Fausset.</p>

<p>The evening passed in mournful quiet. Mildred
played two of Mozart’s sonatas at her aunt’s request—sonatas
which she had played in her girlhood
before the advent of her first and only lover, the
lover who was now left widowed and desolate in that
time which should have been the golden afternoon
of life. As her fingers played those familiar movements,
her mind was at Enderby with the husband
she had deserted. How was he bearing his solitude?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Would he shut his heart against her in
anger, teach himself to live without her? She
pictured him in his accustomed corner of the drawing-room,
with his lamp-lit table, and pile of books
and papers, and Pamela seated on the other side of
the room, and the dogs lying on the hearth, and the
room all aglow with flowers in the subdued light of
the shaded lamps; so different from these colourless
rooms of Miss Fausset’s, with their look as of
vaulted halls, in which voices echo with hollow
reverberations amidst empty space.</p>

<p>And then she thought of her own desolate life,
and wondered what it was to be. She felt as if she
had no strength of mind to chalk out a path for
herself—to create for herself a mission. That
sublime idea of living for others, of a life devoted to
finding the lost ones of Israel—or nursing the sick—or
teaching children the way of righteousness—left
her cold. Her thoughts dwelt persistently upon
her own loves, her own losses, her own ideal of
happiness.</p>

<p>“I am of the earth earthy,” she thought
despairingly, as her fingers lingered over a slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
movement. “If I were like Clement Cancellor,
my own individual sorrow would seem as nothing
compared with that vast sum of human suffering
which he is always trying to lessen.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what your plans are for the future,
Mildred?” said Miss Fausset, laying aside a memoir
of Bishop Selwyn, which she had been reading while
her niece played. “I need hardly tell you that I
shall be pleased to have you here as long as you
care to stay; but I should like to know your scheme
of life—in the event of your persistence in a separation
from your husband.”</p>

<p>“I have made no definite plan, aunt; I shall
spend the autumn in some quiet watering-place in
Germany, and perhaps go to Italy for the winter.”</p>

<p>“Why to Italy?”</p>

<p>“It is the dream of my life to see that country,
and my husband always refused to take me there.”</p>

<p>“For some good reason, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“I believe he had a dread of fever. I know of
no other reason.”</p>

<p>“You are prompt to take advantage of your
independence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed, aunt, I have no idea of that kind.
God help me! my independence is a sorry privilege.
But if any country could help me to forget my
sorrows, that country would be Italy.”</p>

<p>“And after the winter? Do you mean to live
abroad altogether?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I may do. I have thoughts
of entering a sisterhood by and by.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must follow your own course,
Mildred. I can say no more than I have said
already. If you make up your mind to renounce
the world there are sisterhoods all over England,
and there is plenty of good work to be done.
Perhaps after all it is the best life, and that those
are happiest who shut their minds against earthly
affections.”</p>

<p>“As you have done, aunt,” said Mildred, with
respect. “I know how full of good works your life
has been.”</p>

<p>“I have tried to do my duty according to my
lights,” answered the spinster gravely.</p>

<p>The next day was cold and stormy, autumn with
a foretaste of winter. Mildred went to the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
service with her aunt, in the bright new Gothic
church which Miss Fausset’s liberality had helped
to create: a picturesque temple with clustered
columns and richly floriated capitals, diapered roof,
and encaustic pavement, and over all things the
glow of many-coloured lights from painted windows.
Miss Fausset spent the morning in visiting among
the poor. She had a large district out in the
London Road, in a part of Brighton of which
the fashionable Brightonian hardly knoweth the
existence.</p>

<p>Mildred sat in the back drawing-room all the
morning, pretending to read. She took volume
after volume out of the bookcase, turned over the
leaves, or sat staring at a page for a quarter of an
hour at a time, in hopeless vacuity of mind. She
had brooded upon her trouble until her brain
seemed benumbed, and nothing was left of that
sharp sorrow but a dull aching pain.</p>

<p>After luncheon she went out for a solitary walk
on the cliff-road that leads eastward. It was a
relief to find herself alone upon that barren down,
with the great stormy sea in front of her, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
busy world left behind. She walked all the way to
Rottingdean, rejoicing in her solitude, dreading the
return to the stately silver-gray drawing-room and
her aunt’s society. Looking down at the village
nestling in the hollow of the hills, it seemed to her
that she might hide her sorrows almost as well in
that quiet nook as in the remotest valley in Europe;
and it seemed to her also that this place of all
others was best fitted for the establishment of any
charitable foundation in a small way—for a home for
the aged poor, for instance, or for orphan children.
Her own fortune would amply suffice for any such
modest foundation. The means were at her
disposal. Only the will was wanting.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk when she went back to
Lewes Crescent, so she went straight to her room
and dressed for dinner before going to the drawing-room.
The wind, with its odour of the sea, had
refreshed her. She felt less depressed, better able
to face a life-long sorrow, than before she went out,
but physically she was exhausted by the six-mile
walk, and she looked pale as ashes in her black
gown, with its evening bodice, showing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
alabaster throat and a large black enamel locket
set with a monogram in diamonds—L. G., Laura
Greswold.</p>

<p>She entered the inner room. Her aunt was not
there, and there was only one large reading-lamp
burning on a table near the fire. The front
drawing-room was in shadow. She went towards
the piano, intending to play to herself in the
twilight, but as she moved slowly in the direction
of the instrument a strong hand played the closing
bars of a fugue by Sebastian Bach, a chain of solemn
chords that faded slowly into silence.</p>

<p>The hands that played those chords were the
hands of a master. It was hardly a surprise to
Mildred when a tall figure rose from the piano, and
César Castellani stood before her in the dim light.</p>

<p>His hat and gloves were upon the piano, as if
he had just entered the room.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Greswold, how delightful to
find you here! I came to make a late call upon
your aunt—she is always indulgent to my Bohemian
indifference to etiquette—and had not the least idea
that I should see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“I did not know that you and my aunt were
friends.”</p>

<p>“No?” interrogatively. “That is very odd, for
we are quite old friends. Miss Fausset was all
goodness to me when I was an idle undergraduate.”</p>

<p>“Yet when you came to Enderby you brought
an introduction from Mrs. Tomkison. Surely my
aunt would have been a better person—”</p>

<p>“No doubt; but it is just like me to take the first
sponsor who came to hand. When I am in London
I half live at Mrs. Tomkison’s, and I had heard her
rave about you until I became feverishly anxious to
make your acquaintance. I ought perhaps to have
referred to Miss Fausset for my credentials—but I
am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">volage</i> by nature: and then I knew Mrs.
Tomkison would exaggerate my virtues and ignore
my errors.”</p>

<p>Mildred went back to the inner room, and
seated herself by the reading-lamp. Castellani
followed her, and placed himself on the other side
of the small octagon table, leaving only a narrow
space between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“How pale you are!” he said, with a look of
concern. “I hope you are not ill?”</p>

<p>“No, I am only tired after a long walk.”</p>

<p>“I had no idea you had left Enderby.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“You said nothing of your intention of leaving
the neighbourhood the day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“There was no occasion to talk of my plans,”
Mildred answered coldly. “We were all too
anxious about the concert to think of any other
matter.”</p>

<p>“Did you leave soon after the concert?”</p>

<p>“The same evening. I did not know you were
leaving Riverdale.”</p>

<p>“O, I only stayed for the concert. I had
protracted my visit unconscionably, but Mrs. Hillersdon
was good enough not to seem tired of me.
I am in nobody’s way, and I contrived to please her
with my music. Did you not find her delightfully
artistic?”</p>

<p>“I thought her manners charming; and she
seems fond of music, if that is what you mean by
being artistic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“O, I mean worlds more than that. Mrs.
Hillersdon is artistic to her fingers’ ends. In
everything she does one feels the artist. Her dress,
her air, her way of ordering a dinner or arranging a
room—her feeling for literature—she seldom reads—her
feeling for form and colour—she cannot draw
a line—her personality is the very essence of
modern art. She is as a woman what Ruskin is as
a man. Is Miss Ransome with you?”</p>

<p>“No, I have left her to keep house for me.”</p>

<p>It seemed a futile thing to make believe that
all was well at Enderby, to ward off explanations,
when before long the world must know that George
Greswold and his wife were parted for ever. Some
reason would have to be given. That thirst for
information about the inner life of one’s neighbours
which is the ruling passion of this waning century
must be slaked somehow. It was partly on this
account, perhaps, that Mildred fancied it would be a
good thing for her to enter a Sisterhood. The
curious could be satisfied then. It would be said
that Mrs. Greswold had given up the world.</p>

<p>“She is a very sweet girl,” said Castellani<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
thoughtfully; “pretty too, a delicious complexion,
hair that suggests Sabrina after a visit from the
hairdresser, a delightful figure, and very nice manners—but
she leaves me as cold as ice. Why is it
that only a few women in the world have magnetic
power? They are so few, and their influence is so
stupendous. Think of the multitude of women of
all nations, colours, and languages that go to make
up one Cleopatra or one Mary Stuart.”</p>

<p>Miss Fausset came into the room while he was
talking, and was surprised at seeing him in such
earnest conversation with her niece.</p>

<p>“One would suppose you had known each other
for years,” she said, as she shook hands with Castellani,
looking from one to the other.</p>

<p>“And so we have,” he answered gaily. “In
some lives weeks mean years. I sometimes catch
myself wondering what the world was like before I
knew Mrs. Greswold.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known her—without
rodomontade?”</p>

<p>“For about a month, aunt,” replied Mildred.
“I have been asking Mr. Castellani why he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
to me with an introduction from my friend Mrs.
Tomkison, when it would have been more natural
to present himself as a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“O, he has always a motive for what he does,”
Miss Fausset said coldly. “You will stay to dinner,
of course?” she added to Castellani.</p>

<p>“I am free for this evening, and I should like
to stay, if you can forgive my morning coat.”</p>

<p>“I am used to irregularities from you. Give
Mrs. Greswold your arm.”</p>

<p>Franz was at the door, announcing the evening
meal, and presently Mildred found herself seated at
the small round table in the sombre spacious dining-room—a
room with a bayed front, commanding an
illimitable extent of sea—with César Castellani sitting
opposite her. The meal was livelier than the
dinner of last night. Castellani appeared unconscious
that Mildred was out of spirits. He was full of life
and gaiety, and had an air of happiness which was
almost contagious. His conversation was purely
intellectual, ranging through the world of mind
and of fancy, scarcely touching things earthly and
human; and thus he struck no jarring chord in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Mildred’s weary heart. So far as she could be distracted
from the ever-present thought of loss and
sorrow, his conversation served to distract her.</p>

<p>He went up to the drawing-room with the two
ladies, and at Miss Fausset’s request sat down to
the piano. The larger room was still in shadow,
the smaller bright with fire and lamplight.</p>

<p>He played as only the gifted few can play—played
as one in whom music is a sixth sense, but to-night
his music was new to Mildred. He played none of
those classic numbers which had been familiar to
her ever since she had known what music meant.
His muse to-night was full of airy caprices, quips
and cranks and wreathed smiles. It was operatic
music, of the stage stagey; a music which seemed on
a level with Watteau or Tissot in the sister art—gay
to audacity, and sentimental to affectation. It was
charming music all the same—charged with melody,
gracious, complacent, uncertain, like an April day.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, every movement was familiar to
Gertrude Fausset. She sat with her long ivory
knitting-needles at rest on her lap—sat in a dreamy
attitude, gazing at the fire and listening intently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Some melodies seemed to touch her almost to tears.
The love of music ran in the Fausset family, and
it was no surprise to Mildred to see her aunt so
absorbed. What had an elderly spinster to live for
if it were not philanthropy and art? And for the
plastic arts—for pictures and porcelain, statuary or
high-art furniture—Miss Fausset cared not a jot, as
those barren drawing-rooms, with their empty walls
and pallid colour, bore witness. Music she loved
with unaffected devotion, and it was in nowise
strange to find her the friend and patroness of César
Castellani, opposite as were the opinions of the man
who wrote <em>Nepenthe</em> and the woman who had helped
to found the church of St. Edmund the Confessor.</p>

<p>“Play the duet at the end of the second act,”
she said, when he paused after a brilliant six-eight
movement which suggested a joyous chorus.</p>

<p>He played a cantabile accompaniment, like the
flow of summer seas, and then a plaintive melody
for two voices—following, answering, echoing each
other with tearful emphasis—a broken phrase here
and there, as if the singer were choked by a despairing
sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“What is the name of the opera, aunt?” asked
Mildred; “I never heard any of that music before.”</p>

<p>“He has been playing selections from different
operas. That last melody is a duet in an opera called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">La Donna del Pittore</i>.”</p>

<p>“By what composer? It sounded like Flotow.”</p>

<p>“It is not Flotow’s. That opera was written by
Mr. Castellani’s father.”</p>

<p>“I remember he told me his father had written
operas. It is a pity his music was never known in
England.”</p>

<p>“You had better say it was a pity his music
was never fashionable in Paris. Had it been recognised
there, English connoisseurs would have speedily
discovered its merits. We are not a musical nation,
Mildred. We find new planets, but we never discover
new musicians. We took up Weber only to neglect
him and break his heart. We had not taste enough
to understand Mendelssohn’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Melusine</i>.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Castellani’s operas were popular in Italy,
were they not?”</p>

<p>“For a time, yes; but the Italians are as capricious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
as we are dull. César tells me that his father’s
operas have not held the stage.”</p>

<p>“Were they fashionable in your time, aunt, when
you were studying music at Milan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were often performed at that time.
I used to hear them occasionally.”</p>

<p>“And you like them now. They are associated
with your girlhood. I can understand that they
must have a peculiar charm for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are full of old memories.”</p>

<p>“Do you never play or sing yourself, aunt?”</p>

<p>“I play a little sometimes, when I am quite
alone.”</p>

<p>“But never to give pleasure to other people?
That seems unkind. I remember how proud my
father was of your musical talent; but you would
never let us hear you either at The Hook or in
Parchment Street.”</p>

<p>“I have never cared to play or sing before an
audience—since I was a girl. You need not wonder
at me, Mildred. Different people have different
ways of thinking. My pleasure in music of late
years has been the pleasure of a listener. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Castellani is good enough to gratify me sometimes,
as he has done to-night, when he has nothing better
to do.”</p>

<p>“Do not say that,” exclaimed Castellani, coming
into the glow of the hearth, and seating himself
beside Miss Fausset’s armchair. “What can I
have better to do than to commune with a sympathetic
mind like yours—in the language of the
dead? It is almost as if my father’s vanished voice
were speaking to you,” he said, in caressing tones,
bending down to kiss the thin pale hand which lay
idle on the arm of the chair.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">George Greswold</span> was not the kind of man to sit
down in idle submission to Fate under a great wrong
or under a great loss. A feeling of blank despair
had come upon him after his interview with Mrs.
Bell, in the solitude of those deserted rooms where
every object spoke to him of his wife’s absence—where
the influence of her mind and fancy was a part
of the very atmosphere: so much so that in spite
of her farewell letter in his breast-pocket he started
every now and then from his reverie, fancying he
heard her footstep in the corridor, or her voice in an
adjoining room.</p>

<p>His conversation with Bell had brought him
little comfort, but it had not convinced him of the
evil in which his wife so firmly believed. There
was little doubt in his mind that the woman he had
married eighteen years ago was identical with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Mildred’s young companion and John Fausset’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i>. But whether that mysterious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> had
been John Fausset’s daughter was a question open to
doubt. The suspicions of a jealous wife, the opinions
of the servants’ hall, were no conclusive proof.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the weight of evidence leaned
to that one solution of the mystery in Mr. Fausset’s
conduct. That a man should charge himself with
the care of a child of whose parentage and belongings
he could give no satisfactory account—about
whom, indeed, he seemed to have given no account
at all—was a strange thing. Stranger still was his
conduct in bringing that child into his own family,
to the hazard of his domestic peace. Stranger even yet
that he should have gone down to the grave without
giving his daughter any explanation of his conduct
from first to last—that he should have left the story
of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> as dark at the end as it had been at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Painfully conjuring back to life the phantom
forms of a miserable past, George Greswold recalled
the few facts which he had ever known of his first
wife’s history. She was an orphan, without relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
or friends. At eighteen years of age she had been
transferred from a finishing-school at Brussels to the
care of an English artist and his wife, called
Mortimer—middle-aged people, the husband with
a small talent, the wife with a small income, both of
which went further in Brussels than they would
have gone in England. They had an apartment
on one of the new boulevards at Brussels and a
summer retreat in the Ardennes. When the artist
and his wife travelled, Vivien went with them, and
it was on one of these occasions that George Greswold
met her at Florence. Mr. Mortimer had let
his apartment at Brussels for the winter, and had
established himself in the Italian city, where he
worked assiduously at a classic style of art which
nobody ever seemed to buy, though a good many
people pretended to admire.</p>

<p>Vivien Faux. It sounded like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de fantasie</i>.
She told him that she was nobody, and that she
belonged to nobody. She had no home, no
people, no surroundings, no history, no associations.
She had been educated at an expensive school,
and her clothes had been made at a fashionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
dressmaker’s in the Rue Montagne de la Cour.
Everything that a schoolgirl’s fancy could desire had
been provided for her.</p>

<p>“So far as such things go, I was as well off as the
most fortunate of my companions,” she told him;
“but I was a friendless waif all the same, and my
schoolfellows despised me. I drank the cup of
scorn to the dregs.”</p>

<p>Seeing how painful this idea of her isolation was
to her, George Greswold had been careful to avoid
all questioning that might gall the open wound. In
truth he had no keen curiosity about her past existence.
He had taken her for what she was—interesting,
clever, and in great need of a disinterested protector.
It was enough for him to know that she had
been educated as a lady, and that her character was
spotless. His marriage had been one of those
unions which are of all unions the most fatal—a
marriage for pity. A marriage for money, for self-interest,
ambition, or family pride may result happily.
In a union of mutual interests there is at least
a sense of equality, and love may grow with time and
custom; but in a marriage for pity the chain galls on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
both sides, the wife oppressed by a sense of obligation,
the husband burdened with a weight of duty.</p>

<p>Of his wife’s resources, all George Greswold knew
was that she had a life interest in thirty thousand
pounds invested in Consols. The dividends were
sent her half-yearly by a firm of solicitors, Messrs.
Pergament &amp; Pergament, of Lincoln’s Inn Fields.
She had received a letter from the firm a week before
her last birthday, which was her twenty-first, informing
her of her life interest in this sum, over
which she would have no disposing power, nor the
power to anticipate any portion of the interest. The
half-yearly dividends, she was informed, would in
future be sent directly to her at any address she
might appoint.</p>

<p>In acknowledging this communication she begged
to be informed from whom she had inherited this
money, or whether it was the gift of a living benefactor,
and whether the benefactor was a relative.
The reply from Messrs. Pergament &amp; Pergament
was cold and formal. They regretted their inability
to give her any information as to the source
of her income. They were pledged to absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
silence upon this point. In any other matter they
would be happy to be of service to her.</p>

<p>George Greswold had married without a settlement.
The then state of the law, and the conditions
of his wife’s income, made her independent of any
husband whatever. He could not forestall or rob
her of an income of which the capital was in the
custody of other people, and over which she had no
disposing power. He was a poor man himself at the
time, living upon an allowance made him by his
mother, eked out by the labour of his pen as a political
and philosophical writer; but he had the
expectation of the Enderby estate, an expectation
which was all but certainty. One fact alone was
known to him of his wife’s surroundings which
might help him to discover her history, and that
was the name of the firm in Lincoln’s Inn, Messrs.
Pergament &amp; Pergament, and to them he made up
his mind to apply without loss of time.</p>

<p>He went to London on the day after Mildred’s
journey to Brighton, taking Pamela and her dog
with him to an hotel near Hanover Square where
he had occasionally stayed. Pamela had been much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
disturbed by Mildred’s letter, and was full of wonderment,
but very submissive, and ready to do anything
she was told.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be inquisitive or troublesome,
uncle,” she said, as they sat opposite each other in
the train, “but I am sure there is something wrong.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pamela, there is something wrong; but it
is something which will come right again in good
time, I hope. All we can do is to be patient.”</p>

<p>His look of quiet pain, and the haggard lines
which told of sleepless nights and brooding thoughts,
touched Pamela’s tender heart; but she was wise
enough to know that a sorrow big enough to part
husband and wife is not a sorrow to be intruded
upon by an outsider.</p>

<p>Mr. Greswold drove with his niece to the hotel,
established her there with her maid and her terrier
in a private sitting-room, and then started for Lincoln’s
Inn Fields in a hansom.</p>

<p>Messrs. Pergament’s office had a solid and old-established
air, as of an office that had only to do with
wealth and respectability. The clerks in the outer
room seemed to have grown old on the premises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“I should like to see the senior member of the
firm, if he is at liberty,” said Mr. Greswold.</p>

<p>“Mr. Champion Pergament is at Wiesbaden.
He is a very old gentleman, and seldom comes to
the office.”</p>

<p>“The next partner, then—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Danvers Pergament is at his place in
Yorkshire. If you would like to see his son, Mr.
Danvers jun.—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, he will do if there is no one else.”</p>

<p>“There is Mr. Maltby. The firm is now Pergament,
Pergament, &amp; Maltby.”</p>

<p>“Let me see Mr. Danvers Pergament, if you
please. I don’t want to talk to a new man.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Maltby was articled to us seventeen years
ago, sir, and has been in the firm ever since, but I
believe Mr. Pergament is disengaged. Shall I take
him your name?”</p>

<p>George Greswold sent in his card. His name
would be known to some members of the firm, no
doubt—possibly not to others. His married life had
been brief.</p>

<p>He was received in a handsome office by a baldheaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
gentleman of about five-and-forty, who smiled
upon him blandly from a background of oak wainscot
and crimson cloth window-curtains, like an old-fashioned
portrait.</p>

<p>“Pray be seated, Mr. Greswold,” he said, with
the visitor’s card in his hand, and looking from the
card to the visitor.</p>

<p>“Does my name tell you anything about me,
Mr. Pergament?” asked Greswold gravely.</p>

<p>“George Ransome Greswold,” read the lawyer
slowly; “the name of Greswold is unfamiliar to me.”</p>

<p>“But not that of Ransome. Sixteen years ago
my name was George Ransome. I assumed the
name of Greswold on my mother’s death.”</p>

<p>The solicitor looked at him with renewed attention,
as if there were something to startle his professional
equanimity in the former name.</p>

<p>“You remember the name of Ransome?” said
Greswold interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes, it recalls certain events. Very sad circumstances
connected with a lady who was our
client. You would not wish me to go over that
ground, I am sure, Mr. Greswold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“No, there is no occasion to do that. I hope
you believe that I was blameless—or as free from
blame as any man can be in his domestic conduct—in
the matter to which you have alluded?”</p>

<p>“I have no reason to suppose otherwise. I have
never been on the scene of the event. I knew nothing
of it until nearly a year after it happened, and
then my sources of information were of the slenderest,
and my knowledge of painful details never went
beyond this office. Pray be assured that I do not
wish to say one word that can pain you; I would only
ask you to consider me as a totally uninformed person.
I have no charge to make—upon anybody’s account.
I have no questions to ask. The past is forgotten,
so far as I and my firm are concerned.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pergament, for me the past is still living,
and it is exercising a baneful influence over my
present existence. It may blight the rest of my life.
You, perhaps, may help to extricate me from a labyrinth
of perplexity. I want to know who my first
wife was. What was the real name of the young
lady who called herself Vivien Faux, and whom I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
married under that name before the British Consul
at Florence? Who were her parents?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you cannot, or that you will
not?”</p>

<p>“I mean both. I do not know that unfortunate
lady’s parentage. I have no positive knowledge on
the subject, though I may have my own theory. I
know that certain persons were interested in the
young lady’s welfare, and that certain funds were
placed in our charge for her maintenance. After her
death, the capital for which we had been trustees
reverted to those persons. <em>That</em> is the sum-total of
the lady’s history so far as it is known to us.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me the name of the person who
gave my wife her income, who placed her at the
school at Brussels, by whose instructions she was
transferred to the care of Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer?
I want to know that man’s name, for that man must
have been her father.”</p>

<p>“When my father and I undertook that business
for my client, we pledged ourselves to absolute
secrecy. The facts of the case are not known even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
to the other members of the firm. The person in
question was our client, and the secret was lodged
with us. There is not a priest of the Church of
Rome who holds the secrets of the confessional more
sacred than we hold that secret.”</p>

<p>“Even if by keeping it you blight and ruin an
innocent man’s life?”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine any such consequence of our
silence.”</p>

<p>“You cannot? No! Fact is stranger than any
man’s imagination. Do you happen to know the
name of my second wife?”</p>

<p>“I did not even know that you had married
again. You were known to our firm as Mr. Ransome.
We lost sight of you when you changed your
name to Greswold.”</p>

<p>“I have been married—happily married—for
fourteen years; and the name of my wife was
Fausset, Mildred Fausset, daughter of John Fausset,
your client.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pergament had taken up a penknife in a
casual manner, and was trifling with a well-kept
thumb-nail, a fine specimen of the filbert tribe, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
his eyelids lowered in an imperturbable thoughtfulness,
as of a man who was rock. But, cool as he
was, George Greswold noticed that at the name of
Fausset the penknife gave a little jerk, and the outskirts
of the filbert were in momentary danger.
Mr. Pergament was too wary to look up, however.
He sat placid, attentive, with flabby eyelids lowered
over washed-out gray eyes. Mr. Pergament at five-and-forty
was still in the chrysalis or money-making
stage, and worked hard nearly all the year round.
His father, at sixty-seven, was on the Yorkshire
moors, pretending to shoot grouse, and just beginning
to enjoy the butterfly career of a man who had
made enough to live upon.</p>

<p>“Vivien Faux. Does not that sound to your ear
like an assumed name, Mr. Pergament?” pursued
Greswold. “Faux: the first three letters are the
same as in Fausset.”</p>

<p>And then George Greswold told the solicitor how
his second wife had recognised his first wife’s
photograph, as the likeness of a girl whom she
believed to have been her half-sister, and how this
act threatened to divide husband and wife for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Surely Mrs. Greswold cannot be one of those
bigoted persons who pin their faith upon a prohibition
of the Canon Law as if it were the teaching of
Christ—a prohibition which the Roman Church was
always ready to cancel in favour of its elect?” said
the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Unhappily my wife was taught in a very rigid
school. She would perish rather than violate a
principle.”</p>

<p>“But if your first wife were John Fausset’s
natural daughter—what then? The law does not
recognise such affinities.”</p>

<p>“No, but the Church does. The Roman Church
could create a prohibitive affinity in the case of a
cast-off mistress; and it is the privilege of our
Anglican theology in its highest development to
adopt the most recondite theories of Rome. For
God’s sake be plain with me, Mr. Pergament! Was
the girl who called herself Vivien Faux, John
Fausset’s daughter, or was she not?”</p>

<p>“I regret that I cannot answer your question.
My promise to my client was of the nature of an
oath. I cannot violate that promise upon any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
consideration whatever. I must ask you, Mr. Greswold,
as a gentleman, not to urge the matter any
farther.”</p>

<p>“I submit,” said Greswold hopelessly. “If it
is a point of honour with you, I can say no more.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pergament accompanied him to the threshold
of the outer office, and the elderly clerk ushered him
to the wide old landing-place beyond. The lawyer
had been courteous, but not cordial. There was a
shade of distrustfulness in his manner, and he had
pretended to no sympathy with Mr. Greswold in his
difficulties; but George Greswold felt that among
those who knew the history of his former marriage
there was not much likelihood of friendly feeling
towards him. To them he was a man outside the
pale.</p>

<p>He left the office sick at heart. This had been
his only means of coming at the knowledge of his
first wife’s parentage, and this means had failed him
utterly. The surprise indicated by that slight movement
of the lawyer’s hand at the first mention of
John Fausset’s name went far to convince him that
Mildred’s conviction was based on truth. Yet if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
John Fausset were Mr. Pergament’s client, it was
very odd that Mr. Pergament should be ignorant of
the circumstances of Mildred’s marriage, and the
name and surroundings of her husband. Odd assuredly,
but not impossible. On reflection, it seemed
by no means unnatural that Mr. Fausset should
confide his secret to a stranger, and establish a trust
with a stranger, rather than admit his family lawyer
to his confidence. This provision for an illegitimate
daughter would be an isolated transaction in his life.
He would select a firm of approved respectability,
who were unconcerned in his family affairs, with
whom there was no possibility of his wife or daughter
being brought into contact.</p>

<p>George Greswold drove from Lincoln’s Inn to
Queen Anne’s Gate, where he spent ten minutes
with Mrs. Tomkison, and learned all that lady could
tell him about his wife’s movements: how she had
had a long interview with Mr. Cancellor before she
started for Brighton, and how she was looking very
ill and very unhappy. Provided with this small
stock of information, he went back to the hotel and
dined <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Pamela, who had the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
sense not to talk to him, and who devoted all her
attentions to the scion of Brockenhurst Joe.</p>

<p>When the waiters had left the room for good,
and uncle and niece were alone over their coffee,
Greswold became more communicative.</p>

<p>“Pamela, you are a good, warm-hearted girl,
and I believe you would go some way to serve me,”
he said quietly, as he sat looking at Box, who had
folded his delicately-pencilled legs in a graceful attitude
upon the fender, and was amiably blinking at
the fire.</p>

<p>“My dear uncle, I would cut off my head for
you—”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite want that; but I want your loyal
and loving help in this saddest period of my life—yes,
the saddest; sadder even than the sorrow of
last year; and yet I thought there could be no
greater grief than that.”</p>

<p>“Poor Uncle George!” sighed Pamela, bending
over the table to take his hand, and clasping it
affectionately; “command me in anything. You
know how fond I have always been of you—almost
fonder than of my poor father. Perhaps,” she added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
gravely, “it is because I always respected you more
than I did him.”</p>

<p>“I cannot confide in you wholly, Pamela—not
yet; but I may tell you this much. Something
has happened to part my wife and me—perhaps
for life. It is her wish, not mine, that we should
live the rest of our lives apart. There has been
no wrong-doing on either side, mark you. There
is no blame; there has been no angry feeling;
there is no falling off in love. We are both the
victims of an intolerable fatality. I would willingly
struggle against my doom—defy Fate; but my wife
has another way of thinking. She deems it her
duty to make her own life desolate and to condemn
me to a life-long widowhood.”</p>

<p>“Poor Uncle George!”</p>

<p>“She is now at Brighton with her aunt, Miss
Fausset. I am going there to-morrow morning to
see her, if she will let me—perhaps for the last time.
I want to take you with me; and if Mildred carries
out her intention of spending the winter abroad,
I want you to go with her. I want you to wind
yourself into her confidence and into her heart, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
cheer and comfort her, and to shield her from the
malice of the world. Her position will be at best
a painful one—a wife and no wife—separated from
her husband for a reason which she will hardly care
to tell the world, perhaps will hardly confide to
her dearest friend.”</p>

<p>“I will do anything you wish, uncle—go anywhere,
to the end of the world. You know how
fond I am of Aunt Mildred. I’m afraid I like her
better than I do my sister, who is so wrapped up in
that absurd baby that she is sometimes unendurable.
But it seems so awfully strange that you and
aunt should be parted,” continued Pamela, with
a puzzled brow. “I can’t make it out one little
bit. I—I don’t want to ask questions, Uncle
George—at least only just one question: has all
this mysterious trouble anything to do with Mr.
Castellani?”</p>

<p>She turned crimson as she pronounced the
name, but Greswold was too absorbed to notice her
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“With Castellani? No. How should it concern
him?” he exclaimed; and then, remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the beginning of evil, he added, “Mr. Castellani
has nothing to do with our difficulty in a direct
manner; but indirectly his presence at Enderby
began the mischief.”</p>

<p>“O, uncle, you were not jealous of him,
surely?”</p>

<p>“Jealous of him? I jealous of Castellani or
any man living? You must know very little of
my wife or of me, Pamela, when you can ask
such a question.”</p>

<p>“No, no; of course not. It was absurd of me
to suggest such a thing, when I know how my aunt
adores you,” Pamela said hastily.</p>

<p>In spite of this disavowal, she lay awake
half through the night, tormenting herself with
all manner of speculations and wild imaginings
as to the cause of the separation between George
Greswold and his wife and Castellani’s connection
with that catastrophe.</p>

<p>She went to Brighton with her uncle next day,
Box and the maid accompanying them in a second-class
compartment. They put up at an hotel
upon the East Cliff, which was more domestic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
exclusive than the caravansaries towards the setting
sun, and conveniently near Lewes Crescent.</p>

<p>“Shall I go with you at once, uncle?” asked
Pamela, as Greswold was leaving the house. “I
hope Miss Fausset is not a stern old thing, who will
freeze me with a single look.”</p>

<p>“She is not so bad as that, but I will break the
ice for you. I am going to see my wife alone
before I take you to Lewes Crescent. You can go
on the Madeira Walk with Peterson, and give Box
an airing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>George Greswold found his wife sitting alone
near the open piano at which Castellani had made
such exquisite music the night before. She had
been playing a little, trying to find comfort in that
grand music of Beethoven, which was to her as the
prophecies of Isaiah, or the loftiest passages in the
Apocalypse—seeking comfort and hope, but finding
none. And now she was gazing sadly at the waste
of waters, and thinking that her own future life
resembled that barren sea—a wide and sunless
waste, with neither haven nor ship in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>At the sound of her husband’s footsteps entering
unannounced at the further door she started up,
with her heart beating vehemently, speechless and
trembling. She felt as if they were meeting after
years of absence—felt as if she must fling herself
upon his breast and claim him as her own again,
confessing herself too earthly a creature to live
without that sweet human love.</p>

<p>She had to steel herself by the thought of
obedience to a higher law than that of human
passion. She stood before him deathly pale, but
firm as a rock.</p>

<p>He came close up to her, laid his hand upon her
shoulder, and looked her in the face, earnestly,
solemnly even.</p>

<p>“Mildred, is it irrevocable? Can you sacrifice
me for a scruple?”</p>

<p>“It is more than a scruple: it is the certainty
that there is but one right course, and that I must
hold by it to the end.”</p>

<p>“That certainty does not come out of your own
heart or your own mind. It is Cancellor who has
made this law for you—Cancellor, a fanatic, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
knows nothing of domestic love—Cancellor, a man
without a wife and without a home. Is he to judge
between you and me? Is he, who knows nothing
of the sacredness of wedded ties, to be allowed to
break them, only because he wears a cassock and
has an eloquent tongue?”</p>

<p>“It was he who taught me my duty when I was
a child. I accept his teaching now as implicitly as
I accepted it then.”</p>

<p>“And you do not mind breaking my heart:
that does not hurt you,” said Greswold.</p>

<p>His face was pallid as hers, and his lips
trembled, half in anger, half in scorn.</p>

<p>“O, George, you know my own heart is breaking.
There can be no greater pain possible to humanity
than I have suffered since I left you.”</p>

<p>“And you will inflict this agony, and bear this
agony? You will break two hearts because of an
anomaly in the marriage law—a rag of Rome—a
source of profit to Pope and priest—a prohibition
made to be annulled—a trap to fill the coffers of the
Church! Do you know how foolish a law it is,
child, for which you show this blind reverence?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
Do you know that it is only a bigoted minority
among the nations that still abides by it? Do you
know that in that great new world across the seas a
woman may be a wife in one colony, and not a wife
in another—honourable here, despised there? It is
all too foolish. What is it to either of us if my first
wife was your half-sister—a fact which neither of us
can prove or disprove?”</p>

<p>“God help me! it is proved only too clearly to
me. We bear the mark of our birthright in our
faces. You must have seen that, George, long
before I saw Fay’s portrait in your hands. Are we
not alike?”</p>

<p>“Not with the likeness of sisters. There is a
look which might be a family likeness—a look which
puzzled me like the faint memory of a dream when
first I knew you. It was long before I discovered
what the likeness was, and where it lay. At most
it was but a line here and there. The arch of the
brow, the form of the eyelid, an expression about the
mouth when you smile. Such accidental resemblances
are common enough. She was as much
like César Castellani as she is like you. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
seen a look in his face that curiously recalls an expression
of hers.”</p>

<p>“George, if I were not convinced, do you think
I would grieve you, and sacrifice all I have of earthly
happiness? I cannot reason upon this question.
My conscience has answered it for me.”</p>

<p>“So be it. Let conscience be your guide, and
not love. I have done.”</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his, and held them
long, looking in her face as he went on with what
he had to say to her, gravely, without anger, but
with a touch of coldness that placed her very far
away from him, and marked the beginning of a life-long
strangeness.</p>

<p>“It is settled, then,” he said; “we part for
ever; but we are not going to air our story in the
law-courts, or fill latest editions of evening papers
with the details of our misery. We don’t want the
law to annul our marriage upon the ground of a
forbidden affinity, and to cast a slur upon our child
in her grave.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Then, though we are to spend our lives apart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
henceforward, in the eyes of the world you will still
be my wife; and I would not have the lady who
was once my wife placed in a false position. You
cannot wander about the Continent alone, Mildred—you
are too young and too attractive to travel without
companionship. I have brought Pamela to be
your companion. The presence of my niece at your
side will tell the world that you have done no wrong
to me or my name. It may be fairly supposed that
we part from some incompatibility of temper. You
need give no explanations; and you may be assured
I shall answer no questions.”</p>

<p>“You are very good,” she faltered. “I shall be
glad to have your niece with me, only I am afraid
the life will be a dreary one for her.”</p>

<p>“She does not think that. She is much attached
to you. She is a frank warm-hearted girl, with
some common sense under a surface of frivolity.
She is at my hotel near at hand. If you think your
aunt will give her hospitality, she can come to you
at once, and you and she can discuss all your plans
together. If there is anything in the way of business
or money matters that I can arrange for you—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“No, there is nothing,” she said in a low voice;
and then, suddenly, she knelt at his feet, and clasped
his hand, and cried over it.</p>

<p>“George, tell me that you forgive me, before we
part for ever,” she pleaded; “pity me, dear; pity
and pardon!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I forgive you,” he said, gently raising her
in his arms, and leading her to the sofa. “Yes,
child, I pity you. It is not your fault that we are
miserable. It may be better that we should part
thus. The future might be still darker for us if we
did not so part. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>He bent over her as she sat in a drooping
attitude, with her forehead leaning against the end
of the sofa, her hand and arm hanging lax and
motionless at her side. He laid his hand upon
her head as if in blessing, and then left her without
another word.</p>

<p>“The future might be still darker if we did
not part.” She repeated the sentence slowly, pondering
it as if it had been an enigma.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Fausset expressed herself pleased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
receive Miss Ransome as long as it might suit
Mildred’s convenience to stay in Lewes Crescent.</p>

<p>“Mr. Greswold has acted like a gentleman,”
she said, after Mildred had explained that it was
her husband’s wish his niece should accompany her
abroad. “He is altogether superior to the common
run of men. This young lady belongs to the
Anglican Church, I conclude?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly.”</p>

<p>“Then she cannot fail to appreciate the services
at St. Edmund’s,” said Miss Fausset; and thereupon
gave orders that the second-best spare room
should be made ready for Miss Ransome.</p>

<p>Pamela arrived before afternoon tea, bringing
Box, who was immediately relegated to the care of
the maids in the basement, and the information
that her uncle had gone back to Romsey <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Portsmouth,
and was likely to arrive at Enderby some
time before midnight. Pamela was somewhat embarrassed
for the first quarter of an hour, and
was evidently afraid of Miss Fausset; but with
her usual adaptability she was soon at home in
that chilly and colourless drawing-room. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
even reconciled to the banishment of Box, feeling
that it was a privilege to have him anywhere in
that orderly mansion, and intending to get him
clandestinely introduced into her bedroom when the
household retired for the night.</p>

<p>She pictured him as pining with grief in his
exile, and it would have disillusioned her could
she have seen him basking in the glow of the fire
in the housekeeper’s room, snapping up pieces of
muffin thrown him by Franz, and beaming with
intelligence upon the company.</p>

<p>A larger tea-table than usual had been set out
in the inner drawing-room, with two teapots, and a
tempting array of dainty biscuits and tea-cakes,
such as the idle mind loveth. It was Miss
Fausset’s afternoon for receiving her friends, and
from four o’clock upwards carriages were heard to
draw up below, and loquacious matrons with silent
daughters dribbled into the room and talked afternoon
tea-talk, chiefly matters connected with the
church of St. Edmund’s and the various charities
and institutions associated with that edifice.</p>

<p>It seemed very slow, dull talk to the ears of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Pamela, who had been vitiated by sporting society,
in which afternoon tea generally smelt of cartridges
or pigskin, and where conversation was sometimes
enlivened by the handing round of a new gun, or a
patent rat-trap, for general inspection. She tried
to make talk with one of the youngest ladies present,
by asking her if she was fond of tennis: but she felt
herself snubbed when the damsel told her she had
one of the worst districts in Brighton, and no time
for amusements of any kind.</p>

<p>Everybody had taken tea, and it was nearly six
o’clock when the feminine assembly became suddenly
fluttered and alert at the announcement of
two gentlemen of clerical aspect: one tall, bulky,
shabby, and clumsy-looking, with a large pallid
face, heavy features, heavier brows; the other small
and dapper, dressed to perfection in a strictly clerical
fashion, with fair complexion and neat auburn
beard. The first was Mr. Maltravers, Vicar of
St. Edmund’s; the second was his curate, the
Honourable and Reverend Percival Cromer, fourth
son of Lord Lowestoft. It was considered a grand
thing for St. Edmund’s that it had a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
acknowledged power and eloquence for its vicar, and
a peer’s son for its curate.</p>

<p>Mr. Cromer was at once absorbed by a voluble
matron who, with her three daughters, had lingered
in the hope of his dropping in after vespers; but
he contrived somehow to release himself from the
sirens, and to draw Miss Ransome into the conversation.
Miss Fausset in the meantime made
the Vicar known to Mildred.</p>

<p>“You have often heard me speak of my niece,”
she said, when the introduction had been made.</p>

<p>Mildred was sitting apart from the rest, in the
bay-window of the inner room. She had withdrawn
herself there on pretence of wanting light for her
needlework, the same group of azaleas she had been
working upon at Enderby, but really in order to be
alone with her troubled thoughts; and now Miss
Fausset approached her with the tall, ponderous
figure of the priest, in his long threadbare coat.</p>

<p>She looked up, and found him scrutinising her
intently under his heavy brows. It was a clever
face that so looked at her, but it did not engage
her sympathy, or convince her of the owner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
goodness, as Clement Cancellor’s face had always
done.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard you speak of Mrs. Greswold,
your only near relative, I think,” he said, addressing
Miss Fausset, but never taking his eyes off
Mildred.</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair near Mildred, and Miss
Fausset went back to her duty at the tea-table, and
to join in the conversation started by Mr. Cromer,
which had more animation than any previous talk
that afternoon.</p>

<p>“You find your aunt looking well, I hope, Mrs.
Greswold?” began the Vicar, not very brilliantly,
but what his speech wanted in meaning was made
up by the earnestness of his dark gray eyes, under
beetling brows, which seemed to penetrate Mildred’s
inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>“Yes, she looks—as she has always done since
I can remember—like a person superior to all mortal
feebleness.”</p>

<p>“She is superior to all other women I have
ever met, a woman of truly remarkable power and
steadfastness; but with natures like hers the sword<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
is sometimes stronger than the scabbard. That
slender, upright form has an appearance of physical
delicacy, as well as natural refinement. Your aunt’s
mind is a tower of strength, Mrs. Greswold. She
has been my strong rock from the beginning of my
ministry here; but I tremble for the hour when her
health may break down under the task-work she
exacts from herself.”</p>

<p>“I know that she has a district, but I do not
know the details of her work,” said Mildred. “Is
it very hard?”</p>

<p>“It is very hard, and very continuous. She
labours unremittingly among the poor, and she does
a great deal of work of a wider and more comprehensive
kind. She is deaf to no appeal to her
charity. The most distant claims receive her
thoughtful attention, even where she does not feel
it within the boundary-line of her duty to give
substantial aid. She writes more letters than
many a private secretary; and, O Mrs. Greswold—to
you as very near and dear to her—I may say
what I would say to no other creature living. It
has been my blessed office to be brought face to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
face with her in the sacrament of confession. I
have seen the veil lifted from that white and spotless
soul; spotless, yes, in a world of sinners! I
know what a woman your aunt is.”</p>

<p>His low searching tones fell distinctly upon
Mildred’s ear, yet hardly rose above a whisper.
The babble, lay and clerical, went on in the other
drawing-room, and these two were as much alone
in the shadow of the window-curtains and the gray
light of the fading day as if they had been priest
and penitent in a confessional.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">After</span> that interview with her husband, which in
her own mind meant finality, Mildred Greswold’s
strength succumbed suddenly, and for more than a
week she remained in a state of health for which
Miss Fausset’s doctor could find no name more
specific than low fever. She was not very feverish,
he told her aunt. The pulse was rapid and intermittent,
but the temperature was not much above
the normal limit. She was very weak and low, and
she wanted care. He had evidently not quite made
up his mind whether she wanted rousing or letting
alone—whether he would recommend her to spend
the winter at Chamounix and do a little mountaineering,
or to vegetate at Nice or Algiers. “We
must watch her,” he said gravely. “She must not
be allowed to go into a decline.”</p>

<p>Miss Fausset looked alarmed at this, but her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
doctor, an acquaintance of fifteen years, assured her
that there was no cause for alarm; there was only
need of care and watchfulness.</p>

<p>“Her mother died at six-and-thirty,” said Miss
Fausset—“faded away gradually, without any ostensible
disease. My brother did everything that care
and forethought could do, but he could not save her.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Greswold must not be allowed to fade
away,” replied the doctor, with an air of being infallible.</p>

<p>Directly she was well enough to go down to the
drawing-room again, Mildred began to talk of starting
for Switzerland or Germany. She had inflicted
herself and her surroundings upon Lewes
Crescent too long already, she told her aunt; and
although Miss Fausset expressed herself delighted
to have her niece, and reconciled even to Pamela’s
frivolity and the existence of Box in the lower
regions, Mildred felt somehow that her presence
interfered with the even tenor of life in that orderly
mansion. The only person who made light of Miss
Fausset’s idiosyncrasies, came to the house at all
hours, stayed as late as he chose, disturbed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
symmetry of the bookshelves, left Miss Fausset’s
cherished books lying about on chairs and sofas,
and acted in all things after his own fancy, was
César Castellani. His manner towards Miss Fausset
was unalterably deferential; he never wavered in
his respect for her as a superior being; he was full
of subtle flatteries and delicate attentions; yet in
somewise his ways were the ways of a spoiled child,
sure of indulgence and favour. He never stayed in
the house, but had his room at an hotel on the
cliff, and came to Lewes Crescent whenever fancy
prompted, for two or three days at a stretch, then
went back to London, and was seen no more for a
week or so.</p>

<p>Mildred found that Pamela and Mr. Castellani
had seen a great deal of each other during her
illness. They had sung and played together, they
had walked on the cliff—in sight of the drawing-room
windows the whole time, Pamela explained,
and with Miss Fausset’s severe eye upon them.
They had devoted themselves together to the education
of Box, who had learnt at least three new tricks
under their joint instruction, and who, possibly from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
over-pressure, had acquired a habit of trying to bite
Mr. Castellani whenever he had an opportunity.</p>

<p>“It is because he is such a horribly unmusical
dog,” explained Pamela. “He managed to creep up
to the drawing-room the other day when Miss Fausset
was at church, and Mr. Castellani came in and began
to play, and that dreadful Box planted himself near
the piano and howled piteously till I carried him
out.”</p>

<p>“My dearest Pamela, I don’t think Box’s opinion
of Mr. Castellani or his music matters much,”
said Mildred, with gentle gravity, as she lay on the
sofa in the back drawing-room, with Pamela’s hand
clasped in hers; “but it matters a great deal what
you think of him, and I fear you are beginning to
think too much about him.”</p>

<p>“Why should I not think of him, aunt, if I
like—and he likes? I am my own mistress; there
are few girls so independent of all ties; for really
nobody cares a straw for me except you and Uncle
George. Rosalind is wrapped up in her baby, and
Henry is devoted to pigeons, guns, and fishing-tackle.
Do you think it can matter to them whom I marry?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Why should I be sordid, and say to myself, ‘I have
fifteen hundred a year, and I mustn’t marry a man
with less than three thousand’? Why should I not
marry genius if I like—genius even without a
penny?”</p>

<p>“If you could meet with genius, Pamela.”</p>

<p>“You think that Mr. Castellani is not a genius?”</p>

<p>“I think not. He is too versatile and too
showy. All his gifts are on the surface. Genius
is single-minded, aiming at one great thing. Genius
is like still water and runs deep. I admit that
Mr. Castellani is highly gifted as a musician of the
lighter sort; not a man who will leave music behind
him to live for ever. I admit that he has written a
strangely attractive book. But I should be sorry to
call him a genius. I should be very sorry to see
you throw yourself away, as I believe you would if
you were to marry him.”</p>

<p>“That is what a girl’s friends always say to her,”
exclaimed Pamela. “To marry the man one loves is
to throw oneself away.” And then blushing furiously,
she added, “Pray don’t suppose that I am in love
with Mr. Castellani. There has never been one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
word of love between us—except in the clouds, by
way of philosophical discussion. But, as a fatherless
and motherless girl of advanced opinions, I claim
the right to marry genius, if I choose.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl, I cannot dispute your independence;
but I think the sooner we leave this
house the better. The first thing is to make up our
minds where we are to go.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a bit, aunt; only you must not
leave Brighton till you are much stronger. You
will want at least three weeks before you will be able
to stand the fatigue of travelling,” said Pamela,
surveying the invalid with a critical air.</p>

<p>“We can travel by easy stages. I am not
afraid of fatigue. Where shall we go, Pamela—Schwalbach,
Wiesbaden, Vevay, Montreux?”</p>

<p>“O, not Schwalbach, aunt. They took me there
for iron five years ago, when I had outgrown my
strength. Switzerland is always lovely, of course;
but I went there with Rosalind after her baby was
born, and endured the dreariest six weeks of my
existence. Brighton is absolutely delicious at this
time of the year. It would be absurd to rush away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
from the place just when people are beginning to
come here.”</p>

<p>Mildred saw that the case was hopeless, and she
began to think seriously about her responsibilities
in this matter: a frank impetuous girl, her husband’s
niece, eager to cast in her lot with a man who was
obviously an adventurer, living sumptuously with
hardly any obvious means, and who might be a
scoundrel. She remembered her impression of the
face in the church, the Judas face, as she had called it
in her own mind: a foolish impression, perhaps, and
it might be baseless; yet such first impressions are
sometimes warnings not to be lightly set at naught.
As yet nothing had come of that warning: no act of
Castellani’s had shown him a villain; but his advent
had begun the misery of her life. Had she never seen
him she never might have known this great sorrow.
His presence was a constant source of irritation,
tempting her to questioning that might lead to
further misery. Fay’s image had been constantly
in her mind of late. She had brooded over that
wedded life of which she knew nothing—over that
early death which for her was shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“And he could tell me so much, perhaps,” she
said to herself one evening, sitting by the fire in the
inner room, while Castellani played in the distance
yonder between the tall windows that let in the
gray eastern light.</p>

<p>“Her death was infinitely sad.”</p>

<p>Those were the words which he had spoken of
George Greswold’s first wife: of Fay, her Fay, the
one warm love of her childish years, the love that
had stayed with her so long after its object had
vanished from her life. That there was something
underlying those words, some secret which might
add a new bitterness to her sorrow, was the doubt
that tortured Mildred as she sat and brooded by the
fire, while those lovely strains of Mendelssohn’s
“I waited for the Lord” rose in slow solemnity from
the distant piano, breathing sounds of peacefulness
where there was no peace.</p>

<p>Mr. Castellani had behaved admirably since her
convalescence. He had asked no questions about
her husband, had taken her presence and Pamela’s
for granted, never hinting a curiosity about this
sudden change of quarters. Mildred thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
her aunt had told him something about her separation
from her husband. It was hardly possible that
she could have withheld all information, seeing the
familiar terms upon which those two were; and it
might be, therefore, that his discretion was the
result of knowledge. He had nothing to learn, and
could easily seem incurious.</p>

<p>Mildred now discovered that one source of Castellani’s
influence with her aunt was the work he
had done for the choir of St. Edmund’s. It was to
his exertions that the choral services owed their
excellence. The Vicar loved music only as a child
or a savage loves it, without knowledge or capacity;
and it was Castellani who chose the voices for the
choir, and helped to train the singers. It was Castellani
who assisted the organist in the selection of
recondite music, which gave an air of originality to
the services at St. Edmund’s, and brought the odour
of mediævalism and the fumes of incense into the
Gothic chancel. Castellani’s knowledge of music,
ancient and modern, was of the widest. It was his
musical erudition which gave variety to his improvisations.
He could delight an admiring circle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
meandering reminiscences of Lully, Corelli, Dussek,
Spohr, Clementi, Cherubini, and Hummel, in which
only the modulations were his own.</p>

<p>In this interval of convalescence Mrs. Greswold’s
life fell into a mechanical monotony which suited her
as well as any other kind of life would have done.
For the greater part of the day she sat in the low
armchair by the fire, a table with books at her side,
and her work-basket at her feet. Those who cared
to observe her saw that she neither worked nor
read. She took up a volume now and again, opened
it, looked at a page with dreamy eyes for a little
while, and then laid it aside. She took up the
frame with the azaleas, worked half-a-dozen stitches,
and put the frame down again. Her days were
given to long and melancholy reveries. She lived
over her married life, with all its happiness, with its
one great pain. She contemplated her husband’s
character—such a perfect character it had always
seemed to her; and yet his one weak act, his one
suppression of truth, had wrought misery for them
both. And then with ever-recurring persistency she
thought of Fay, and Fay’s unexplained fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“I know him so well, his wife of fourteen years,”
she said to herself. “Can I doubt for an instant
that he did his duty to her; that he was loyal and
kind; that whatever sadness there was in her fate
it could have been brought about by no act of his?”</p>

<p>Pamela behaved admirably all this time. She
respected Mildred’s silence, and was not overpoweringly
gay. She would sit at her aunt’s feet working,
wrapped in her own thoughts, or poring over a well-thumbed
Shelley, which seemed to her to express all
her emotions for her without any trouble on her part.
She found her feelings about César Castellani made
to measure, as it were, in those mystic pages, and
wondered that she and Shelley could be so exactly
alike.</p>

<p>When Mildred was well enough to go out of
doors Miss Fausset suggested a morning with her
poor.</p>

<p>“It will brace your nerves,” she said, “and help
you to make up your mind. If you have really a
vocation for the higher life, the life of self-abnegation
and wide usefulness, the sooner you enter upon
it the better. Mind, I say <em>if</em>. You know I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
given you my advice conscientiously as a Christian
woman, and my advice is that you go back to your
husband, and forget everything but your duty to
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, aunt, I know; but you and I think differently
upon that point.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” with an impatient sigh. “You
are obstinate enough there: you have made up your
mind so far. You had better make it up a little
further. At present you are halting between two
opinions.”</p>

<p>Mildred obeyed with meekness and indifference.
She was not interested in Miss Fausset’s district;
she had given no thought yet to the merits of life in
a Christian community, among a handful of pious
women working diligently for the suffering masses.
Her only thought had been of that which she had
lost, not of what she might gain.</p>

<p>Miss Fausset came in from the morning service
at half-past eight, breakfasted sparingly, and at nine
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne plus ultra</i> brougham, the perfection of severity
in coach-building, was at the door, and the perfect
brown horse was champing his bit and rattling his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
brazen headgear in over-fed impatience to be off. It
seemed to be the one aim of this powerful creature’s
life to run away with Miss Fausset’s brougham, but
up to this point his driver had circumvented him.
He made very light of the distance between the
aristocratic East Cliff and the shabbiest outlying
district of Brighton, at the fag end of the London
Road, and here Mildred saw her aunt in active work
as a ministering angel to the sick and the wretched.</p>

<p>It was only the old, old story of human misery
which she saw repeated under various forms; the
old, old evidence of the unequal lots that fall from
the urn of Fate—Margaret in her sky-blue boudoir,
Peggy staggering under her basket of roses—for
some only the flowers, for others only the thorns.
She saw that changeless background of sordid
poverty which makes every other sorrow harder to
bear; and she told herself that the troubles of the
poor were heavier than the troubles of the rich.
Upon her life sorrow had come, like a thunderbolt
out of a summer sky; but sorrow was the warp and
woof of these lives; joy or good luck of any kind
would have been the thunderclap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>She saw that her aunt knew how to deal with
these people, and that underneath Miss Fausset’s
hardness there was a great power of sympathy.
Her presence seemed everywhere welcome; and
people talked freely to her, unbosoming themselves
of every trouble, confident in her power to understand.</p>

<p>“Me and my poor husband calls your aunt our
father confessor, ma’am,” said a consumptive tailor’s
wife to Mildred. “We’re never afraid to tell her
anything—even if it seems foolish like—and she
always gives us rare good advice—don’t she, Joe?”</p>

<p>The invalid nodded approvingly over his basin of
beef-tea, Miss Fausset’s beef-tea, which was as comforting
as strong wine.</p>

<p>In one of the houses they found an Anglican
Sister, an elderly woman, in a black hood, to whom
Miss Fausset introduced her niece. There was an
old man dying by inches in the next room; and the
Sister had been sitting up with him all night, and
was now going home to the performance of other
duties. Mildred talked with her for some time
about her life, and heard a great many details of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
that existence which seemed to her still so far off,
almost impossible, like a cold pale life beyond the
grave. How different from that warm domestic life
at Enderby! amidst fairest surroundings, in those
fine old rooms, where every detail bore the impress
of one’s own fancy, one’s own pursuits: a selfish life,
perhaps, albeit tempered with beneficence to one’s
immediate surroundings; selfish inasmuch as it was
happy and luxurious, while true unselfishness must
needs surrender everything, must refuse to wear
purple and fine linen and to fare sumptuously, so
long as Lazarus lies at the gate shivering and
hungry.</p>

<p>Her aunt almost echoed her thoughts presently
when she spoke of her goodness to the poor.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Mildred, I do some little good,” she
said, almost impatiently; “but not enough—not
nearly enough. It is only women like that Sister
who do enough. What the rich give must count for
very little in the eyes of the Great Auditor. But I
do my best to make up for a wasted girlhood. I
was as foolish and as frivolous as your young friend
Pamela once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“That reminds me, aunt, I want so much to
talk to you about Pamela.”</p>

<p>“What of her?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that she admires Mr. Castellani.”</p>

<p>“Why should she not admire him?”</p>

<p>“But I suspect she is in danger of falling in
love with him.”</p>

<p>“Let her fall in love with him—let her marry
him—let her be happy with him if she can.”</p>

<p>There was a recklessness in this counsel which
shocked Mildred, coming from such a person as Miss
Fausset.</p>

<p>“My dear aunt, it is a very serious matter.
George gave Pamela to me for my companion. I
feel myself responsible for her happiness.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t interfere with her happiness. Let
her marry the man she loves.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, if he were a good man, and
if her uncle had no objection. But I know so little
about Mr. Castellani and his surroundings.”</p>

<p>“He has no surroundings—his mother and
father are dead. He has no near relatives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“And his character, aunt; his conduct? What
do you know of those?”</p>

<p>“Only so much as you can see that I know of
them. He comes to my house, and makes himself
agreeable to me and my friends. He has given
valuable help in the formation and management of
the choir. If I am interested in a concert for a
charity he sings for me, and works for me like a
slave. All his talents are at my service always.
I suppose I like him as well as I should like a
favourite nephew, if I had nephews from whom to
choose a favourite. Of his character—outside my
house—I know nothing. I do not believe he has a
wife hidden away anywhere; and if Pamela marries
him, she can make her intention public in good time
to prevent any fiasco of that kind.”</p>

<p>“You speak very scornfully, aunt, as if you had
a poor opinion of Mr. Castellani.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I have a poor opinion of mankind in
general, Mildred. Your father was a good man, and
your husband is another. We ought to think ourselves
lucky to have known two such men in our
lives. As to César Castellani, I tell you again I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
know no more of him than you—or very little more—though
I have known him so much longer.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“About fifteen years.”</p>

<p>“And how was he introduced to you?”</p>

<p>“O, he introduced himself, on the strength of
the old connection between the Faussets and the
Felixes. It was just before he went to the University.
He was very handsome, very elegant, and
very much in advance of his years in manners and
accomplishments. He amused and interested me,
and I allowed him to come to my house as often as
he liked.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about his means?”</p>

<p>“Nothing definite. He came into a small fortune
upon his mother’s death, and ran through it. He
has earned money by literary work, but I cannot tell
you to what extent. If Miss Ransome marry him,
I think she may as well make up her mind to keep
him. He belongs to the butterfly species.”</p>

<p>“That is rather a humiliating prospect for a
wife—rather like buying a husband.”</p>

<p>“That is a point for Miss Ransome to consider.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
I don’t think she is the kind of girl to care much
what her whim costs her.”</p>

<p>The brown horse, panting for more work, drew
up in front of Miss Fausset’s house at this juncture,
fidgeted impatiently while the two ladies alighted,
and then tore round to his mews.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a handful with him to-day, I guess,
mate,” said a humble hanger-on, as Miss Fausset’s
coachman stretched his aching arms. “He’s a fine
’oss, but I’d rather you drove ’im than me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what he is,” replied the coachman:
“he’s too good for his work. That’s his complaint.
Dodging in and out of narrer streets, and makin’
mornin’ calls upon work’ouse paupers, don’t suit
<em>him</em>.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The time had come when Mildred had to make
up her mind where she would go, and having all the
world to choose from, and just the same hopeless
feeling that Eve may have had on leaving Eden, the
choice was a matter of no small difficulty. She
sat with a Continental “Bradshaw” in her hand,
turning the leaves and looking at the maps, irresolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
and miserable. Pamela, who might have
decided for her, clearly hankered after no paradise
but Brighton. Her idea of Eden was a house in
which Castellani was a frequent visitor.</p>

<p>It was too late for most of the summer places,
too early for Algiers or the Riviera. Pamela would
not hear of the Rhine or any German watering-place.
Montreux might do, perhaps, or the Engadine;
but Pamela hated Switzerland.</p>

<p>“Would it not do to spend the winter in Bath?”
she said. “There is very nice society in Bath, I
am told.”</p>

<p>“My dear Pamela, I want to get away from
society if I can; and I want to be very far from
Enderby.”</p>

<p>“Of course. It was thoughtless of me to suggest
a society place. Bath, too, within a stone’s throw.
Dearest aunt, I will offer no more suggestions. I
will go anywhere you like.”</p>

<p>“Then let us decide at once. We will go to
Pallanza, on Lago Maggiore. I have heard that it
is a lovely spot, and later we can go on to Milan or
Florence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“To Italy! That is like the fulfilment of a
dream,” said Pamela with a sigh, feeling that Italy
without César Castellani would be like a playhouse
when the curtain has gone down and all the lights
are out.</p>

<p>She was resigned, however, and not without hope.
Castellani might propose before they left Brighton,
when he found that parting was inevitable. He had
said some very tender things, but of that vaguely
tender strain which leaves a man uncommitted. His
words had been full of poetry, but they might have
applied to some absent mistress, or to love in the
abstract. Pamela felt that she had no ground for
exultation.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Mildred warned her against
the danger of such an alliance.</p>

<p>“Consider what a wretched match it would be
for you, Pamela,” she said. “Think how different
from your sister Rosalind’s marriage.”</p>

<p>“Different! I should hope so, indeed! Can
you imagine, Aunt Mildred, that <em>I</em> would marry
such a man as Sir Henry Mountford, a man who has
hardly a thought outside his stable and his gunroom?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Do you know that he spends quite a quarter
of every day in the saddle-room, allowing for the
wet days, on which he almost lives there? I asked
him once why he didn’t have his lunch sent over to
the stables, instead of keeping us waiting a quarter
of an hour, and coming in at last smelling like a
saddler’s shop.”</p>

<p>“He is a gentleman, notwithstanding, Pamela,
and Rosalind seems to get on very well with him.”</p>

<p>“‘As the husband is the wife is,’ don’t you know,
aunt. You and Uncle George suit each other
because you are both intellectual. I should be
miserable if I married a man who had done nothing
to distinguish himself from the common herd.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But do you think you could be very
happy married to an accomplished idler who would
live upon your fortune—who would have everything
to gain, from the most sordid point of view, by
marrying you, and of whose fidelity you could never
be sure?”</p>

<p>“But I should be sure of him. My instinct
would tell me if he were really in love with me.
You must think me very silly, Aunt Mildred, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
think I could be deceived in such a matter as
that.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In spite of Pamela’s confidence in her own instinct,
or, in other words, in her own wisdom,
Mildred was full of anxiety about her, and was very
eager to place her charge beyond the reach of César
Castellani’s daily visits and musical talent. She felt
responsible to her husband for his niece’s peace of
mind; doubly responsible in that Pamela’s interest
had been subordinated to her own comfort and well-being.</p>

<p>She had other reasons for wishing to escape
from Mr. Castellani’s society. That instinctive aversion
she had felt at sight of the unknown face in the
church was not altogether a sentiment of the past,
a prejudice overcome and forgotten. There were
occasions when she shrank from the Italian’s gentle
touch, a delicate white hand hovering for a moment
above her own as he offered her a book or a newspaper;
there were times when his low sympathetic
voice was a horror to her; there were times when
she told herself that her self-respect as a wife hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
permitted of her breathing the same air that he
breathed.</p>

<p>Innocent and simple-minded as her closely-sheltered
life had kept her, in all thoughts, ways,
and works unlike the average woman of society,
Mildred Greswold was a woman, and she could not
but see that César Castellani’s feelings for her were
of a deeper kind than any sentiment with which
Pamela Ransome’s charms had inspired him. There
were moments when his voice, his face, his manner
told his secret only too plainly; but these were but
glimpses of the truth, hurried liftings of the curtain,
which the man of society let drop again before he
had too plainly betrayed himself. He had been
careful to keep his secret from Pamela. It was
only to the object of his worship that he had revealed
those presumptuous dreams of his, and to her
only in such wise as she must needs ignore. It
would have seemed self-conscious prudery to rebuke
indications so subtle and so casual; but Mildred
could not ignore them in her own mind, and she
waited anxiously for the hour in which she would
be well enough to travel. She had all her plans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
made, had engaged a courier—a friend of Miss
Fausset’s Franz—and had arranged her route with
him: first Northern Italy, and then the South. She
wanted to make Pamela’s exile as bright and as
profitable to her as she could. The life she was
arranging was by no means the kind of life that
Clement Cancellor would have counselled. It would
have seemed to that stern labourer a life of self-indulgence
and frivolity. But the time for the
higher ideal would come by and by, perhaps, when
this sense of misery, this benumbed feeling of indifference
to all things, had worn off, and she should
be strong enough to think a little more about other
people’s sorrows and a little less about her own.</p>

<p>Mr. Maltravers urged upon her the duty of
staying in Brighton, and working as her aunt worked.
He had been told that Mrs. Greswold was a woman
of independent fortune, and that she had separated
herself from a husband she fondly loved, upon a
question of principle. It was just such a woman as
this that Samuel Maltravers liked to see in his
church. Such women were the elect of the earth,
predestined to contribute to the advancement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
clerics and the building of chancels and transepts.
The chancel at St. Edmund’s was a noble one,
needing no extension, its only fault being that it
was too big for the church. But there was room for
a transept. The church had been so planned as to
allow of its ultimate cruciform shape, and that
transept was the dream of Mr. Maltravers’ life.
Scarcely had Mrs. Greswold’s story dropped in
measured syllables from Miss Fausset’s lips than
Mr. Maltravers said to himself, “This lady will
build my transept.” A woman who could leave a
beloved husband on a question of principle was just
the kind of woman to sink a few superfluous thousands
upon the improvement of such a fane as St.
Edmund’s. Every seat in that fashionable temple
was occupied. More seat-room was a necessity.
The hour had come, and the—woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Maltravers endeavoured to convince Mrs.
Greswold that Brighton was the one most fitting
sphere for an enlightened woman’s labours. Brighton
cried aloud for a Christian sister’s aid. It had all
the elements in which the heaven-born missionary
delights. Phenomenal wealth on the one side, abject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
poverty on the other; fashion in the foreground,
sin and misery behind the curtain. Brighton was
Pagan Rome in little. Together with the advanced
civilisation, the over-refinement, the occult
pleasures, the art, the luxury, the beauty, the burning
of the Seven-hilled City, Brighton had all the
corrupting influences of her Pagan sister. Brighton
was rotten to the core—a lovely simulacrum—a
Dead Sea apple—shining, golden, doomed, damned.</p>

<p>As he uttered that last terrific word Mr. Maltravers
sank his voice to that bass depth some of us
can remember in Bishop Wilberforce’s climatic syllables;
and so spoken, the word seemed permissible
in any serious drawing-room, awful rather than profane.</p>

<p>It was in vain, however, that the Vicar of St.
Edmund’s strove to convince Mildred that her
mission was immediate, and in Brighton; that in
his parish, and there alone, could her loftiest dreams
find their fulfilment.</p>

<p>“I hope to do some little good to my fellow-creatures
by and by,” she said meekly, “but I do
not feel that the time has come yet. I am incapable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
of anything except just existing. I believe my
aunt has told you that I have had a great sorrow—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, poor wounded heart, I know, I know.”</p>

<p>“I mean to work by and bye—when I have
learned to forget myself a little. Sorrow is so
selfish. Just now I feel stupid and helpless. I
could do no good to any one.”</p>

<p>“You could build my transept,” thought Mr.
Maltravers, but he only sighed, and shook his head,
and murmured gently, “Well, well, we must wait;
we must hope. There is but one <em>earthly</em> consolation
for a great grief—I will say nothing of heavenly
comfort—and that consolation is to be found in
labouring for the good of our sinning, sorrowing
fellow-creatures, and for the glory of God—for the
glory of God,” repeated Mr. Maltravers, harping on
his transept. “There are mourners who have left
imperishable monuments of their grief, and of their
piety, in some of the finest churches of this land.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Upon the evening on which Mr. Maltravers had
pleaded for Brighton, Miss Fausset and her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>
were alone together during the half-hour before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
dinner; the lady resting after a long day in her
district: a composed, quiet figure, in fawn-coloured
silk gown and point lace kerchief, seated erect in
the high-backed chair, with folded hands, and eyes
gazing thoughtfully at the fire; the gentleman lounging
in a low chair on the other side of the hearth
in luxurious self-abandonment, his red-brown eyes
shining in the fire-glow, and his red-brown hair
throwing off glints of light.</p>

<p>They had been talking, and had lapsed into
silence; and it was after a long pause that Miss
Fausset said,</p>

<p>“I wonder you have not made the young lady an
offer before now.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I am not in love with the young lady?”</p>

<p>“You have been too assiduous for that supposition
to occur to me. You have haunted this house
ever since Miss Ransome has been here.”</p>

<p>“And yet I am not in love with her.”</p>

<p>“She is a pretty and attractive girl, and disposed
to think highly of you.”</p>

<p>“And yet I am not in love with her,” he repeated,
with a smile which made Miss Fausset angry. “To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
think that you should turn matchmaker, you who
have said so many bitter things of the fools who fall in
love, and the still greater fools who marry; <em>you</em> who
stand alone like a granite monolith, like Cleopatra’s
Needle, or the Matterhorn, or anything grand and
solitary and unapproachable; you to counsel the
civilised slavery we call marriage!”</p>

<p>“My dear César, I can afford to stand alone;
but you cannot afford to surrender your chance of
winning an amiable wife with fifteen hundred a year.”</p>

<p>“That for fifteen hundred a year!” exclaimed
Castellani, wafting an imaginary fortune from the
tips of his fingers with airy insolence. “Do you
think I will sell myself—for so little?”</p>

<p>“That high-flown tone is all very well; but there
is one fact you seem to ignore.”</p>

<p>“What is that, my kindest and best?”</p>

<p>“The fact that you are a very expensive person,
and that you have to be maintained somehow.”</p>

<p>“That fact shall never force me to marry where
I cannot love. At the worst, art shall maintain me.
When other and dearer friends prove unkind, I will
call upon my maiden aunts the Muses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“The Muses hitherto have hardly paid for the
gardenias in your buttonhole.”</p>

<p>“O, I know I am not a man of business. I
lack the faculty of pounds, shillings, and pence,
which is an attribute of some minds. I have scattered
my flowers of art upon all the highways instead
of nailing the blossoms against a wall and waiting
for them to bear fruit. I have been reckless, improvident—granted;
and you, out of your abundance,
have been kind. Your words imply a threat. You
wish to remind me that your kindness cannot go on
for ever.”</p>

<p>“There are limits to everything.”</p>

<p>“Hardly to your generosity; certainly not to
your wealth. As you garner it, that must be inexhaustible.
I cannot think that you would ever turn
your back upon me. The link between us is too
tender a bond.”</p>

<p>Miss Fausset’s face darkened to deepest night.</p>

<p>“Tender do you call it?” she exclaimed. “If
the memory of an unpardonable wrong is tender—”
and then, interrupting herself, she cried passionately,
“César Castellani, I have warned you against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
slightest reference to the past. As for my generosity,
as you call it, you might be wiser if you
gave it a lower name—caprice; caprice which may
weary at any moment. You have a chance of making
an excellent match, and I strongly advise you to
take advantage of it.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I disregard your advice, much
as I respect your judgment upon all other subjects.”</p>

<p>“You have other views, I suppose, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have other views.”</p>

<p>“You look higher?”</p>

<p>“Infinitely higher,” he answered, with his hands
locked above his head in a carelessly graceful attitude,
and with his eyes gazing at the fire.</p>

<p>He looked like a dreaming fawn: the large, full
eyes, the small peaked beard, and close-cut hair
upon the arched forehead were all suggestive of the
satyr tribe.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Pamela came smiling in,
self-conscious, yet happy, delighted at seeing that
picturesque figure by the hearth.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE TIME HAS COME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Three</span> days later Mildred and her young companion
started for Italy. The doctor declared that the
departure was premature—Mrs. Greswold was not
strong enough to undertake such a fatiguing journey.
But modern civilisation has smoothed the roads that
lead over the civilised world, and for a lady who
travels with a maid and a courier, journeys are
rendered very easy; besides, Mildred had made up
her mind to leave Brighton at any hazard.</p>

<p>The hour of parting came for Pamela and Castellani,
and although the young lady took care to
remind him at least a dozen times a day of that
impending severance, not one word of the future, or
of any cherished hope on his part, fell from his lips.
And yet it had seemed to Pamela that he was devoted
to her, that he only waited for the opportunity to
speak. It seemed to her also that he felt the pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of parting, for he had an air of deepest melancholy
daring these farewell days, and talked only of saddest
themes. He was in Lewes Crescent nearly all day
long—he played the mournfullest strains—he behaved
like a man oppressed with a secret sorrow;
but never a word of love or marriage did he breathe
to Pamela. He pressed her hand gently, with an
almost paternal affection, as she leant out of the
carriage which was to take her to the station, and
bade him a last good-bye.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” she half sang, half sobbed, in the
darkness at the back of the hired landau, as they
drove bumping down St. James’s street. “Good-bye,
summer; good-bye, everything!”</p>

<p>She did not even glance at Hannington’s autumn
fashions as they drove up the hill. She felt that life
was no longer worth dressing for.</p>

<p>“He never could have cared for me,” she
thought, as she dropped her silent tears upon
Box’s thoroughbred neck, “and yet he seemed—he
seemed! Does he seem like that to every girl, I
wonder? Is he all seeming?”</p>

<p>After this came a leisurely journey, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
long, slow weeks of a luxurious repose amidst fairest
surroundings—a life which to those who have lived
and fought the great battle, and come wounded but
yet alive out of the fray, is the life paradisaic; but
for the fresh, strong soul panting for emotions
and excitements, like a young bird that yearns to
try the strength of his wings, this kind of languid
existence seems like a foretaste of death and nothingness.
Mountains and lakes were not enough for
Pamela—the azure of an Italian sky, the infinite
variety of sunset splendours, the brightness of a
morning heralded by a roseate flush on snow-capped
hills—all these were futile where the heart was
empty. Mildred’s maturer grief found some consolation
in these exquisite surroundings; but Pamela
wanted to live, and those encircling mountains
seemed to her as the walls of a gigantic prison.</p>

<p>“It was so nice at Brighton,” she said, looking
along the burnished mirror of the lake with despondent
eyes, tired of the mystery of those reflected
mountains, descending into infinite depths, a world
inverted: “so gay, so cheery—always something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
going on. Don’t you think, aunt, that the air of
this place is very relaxing?”</p>

<p>That word relaxing is the keynote of discontent.
It is a word that can blight the loveliest spots the
sun ever shone upon. It is the speck upon the peach.
Be sure that before ever he mentioned the apple,
Satan told Eve that Eden was very relaxing.</p>

<p>“I hope you are not unhappy here, my dear
Pamela?” said Mildred, evading the question.</p>

<p>“Unhappy? O, no, indeed, dear aunt! I could not
be otherwise than happy with you anywhere. There
are lots of people who would envy me living on the
shore of Lago Maggiore, and seeing those delightful
mountains all day long; but I did so enjoy Brighton—the
theatre, the Pavilion; always something
going on.”</p>

<p>The two ladies had their own suite of apartments
in the hotel, and lived in that genteel seclusion
which is the privilege of wealth as well as of rank
all over the world. Pamela envied the tourists of
Cook and Gaze, as she saw them trooping into the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</i>, or heard their clatter in the public
drawing-room. It was all very well to sit in one’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
own balcony, gazing at the placid lake, while the
rabble amused themselves below. One felt one’s
superior status, and the advantage of being somebody
instead of nobody; but when the rabble danced or
acted charades, or played dumb crambo, or squabbled
over a game at nap, they seemed to have the best of
it somehow.</p>

<p>“I almost wish I had been born a vulgarian,”
sighed Pamela one evening, when the tourists were
revolving to the “Myosotis Waltz” banged out on
a cast-iron grand in the salon below.</p>

<p>Mildred did all she could in the way of excursionising
to enliven the dulness of their solitary life;
but the beauties of Nature palled upon Pamela’s lively
mind. However the day might be occupied in drives
to distant scenes of surpassing loveliness, the ever-lengthening
evenings had to be spent in the Louis
Quatorze salon, where no visitors dropped in to
disturb the monotony of books and work, piano and
pet-dog.</p>

<p>For Mildred, too, those evening hours seemed
unutterably long, and as autumn deepened into
winter, her burden seemed heavier to bear. Time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
brought no consolation, offered no hope. She had
lost all that had made life worth living. First, the
child who represented all that was brightest and
fairest and gayest and most hopeful in her life;
next, the husband who was her life itself, the prop
and staff, the column around which every tendril of
her being was entwined. There was nothing for her
in the future but a life of self-abnegation, of working
and living for others. The prospect seemed dark
and dreary, and she knew now how small a margin
of her life had been devoted to God. The idea of
devoting herself wholly was too repellent. She knew
now that she was very human, wedded to earthly
loves and earthly happiness, needing a long purgation
before she could attain the saintly attitude.</p>

<p>She thought of Enderby every night as she sat
in silent melancholy beside the hearth, where a
solitary log crumbled slowly to white ashes on
the marble, and where the faint warmth had a
perfume of distant pine-woods; she thought of
Enderby and its widowed master. Was he living
there still, or was he, too, a wanderer? She had
heard but little of his movements since she left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
England. Pamela had written to him, and he had
replied, but had said very little about himself.
The only news in Rosalind’s letters was of the extraordinary
development—intellectual and otherwise—of
the baby, and the magnitude of Sir Henry’s bag.
Beyond the baby and the bag, Lady Mountford’s
pen rarely travelled.</p>

<p>Mildred thought of that absent husband with
an aching heart. There were times when she asked
herself if she had done well—when she was tempted
to total surrender—when the pen was in her hand
ready to write a telegram imploring him to come
to her—or when she was on the point of giving her
orders for an immediate return to England. But
pride and principle alike restrained her. She had
taken her own course, she had made up her mind
deliberately, after long thought and many prayers.
She could not tread the backward way, the primrose
path of sin. She could but pray for greater strength,
for loftier purpose, for that grand power of self-forgetfulness
which makes for heaven.</p>

<p>Christmas came and found her in this frame
of mind. There were very few tourists now, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the long corridors had a sepulchral air, the snowy
mountain-tops were blotted out by mist and rain.
For Pamela, Christmastide had been a season of much
gaiety hitherto—a season of new frocks and many
dances, hunting and hunt-balls, and the change
was a severe test of that young lady’s temper. She
came through the ordeal admirably, never forgot that
she had promised her uncle to be his wife’s faithful
companion, and amused herself as best she could
with Italian music and desultory studies. She read
Mr. Sinnett’s books, studied Bohn’s edition of
Plato’s Dialogues, addled her youthful brain with
various theories of a far-reaching kind, and fancied
herself decidedly mediumistic. That word mediumistic
possessed a peculiar fascination for her. She
had looked at César Castellani’s eyeballs, which
were markedly globular—seeming, as it were,
reflecting surfaces for the spirit world, a sure indication
of the mediumistic temperament. She had
seen other signs; and now in this romantic solitude,
sauntering by the lake in the misty winter air, just
before sundown, she fancied herself almost in communion
with that absent genius. Distance could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
not separate two people when both were eminently
mediumistic.</p>

<p>“I believe he is thinking of me at this very
moment,” she said to herself one afternoon at the
end of the year, “and I have a kind of feeling that
I shall see him—bodily—very soon.”</p>

<p>She forgot to reckon with herself that this kind
of feeling could count for very little, since she had
experienced it in greater or less degree ever since
she had left Brighton. In almost every excursion she
had beguiled the tedium of the way with some pleasant
day-dream. Castellani would appear in the
most unlooked-for manner at the resting-place where
they were to lunch. He would have followed them
from England at his leisure, and would come upon
them unannounced, pleased to startle her by his
sudden apparition. In absence she had recalled so
many tender speeches, so many indications of regard;
and she had taught herself to believe that he really
cared for her, and had but been withheld from a
declaration by a noble dignity which would not stoop
to woo a woman richer than himself.</p>

<p>“He is poor and proud,” she thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Poor and proud. How sweet the alliteration
sounded!</p>

<p>She had thought of him so incessantly that it
was hardly a coincidence, and yet it seemed to her a
miracle when his voice sounded behind her in the
midst of her reverie.</p>

<p>“You ought not to be out of doors, Miss Ransome,
when the sun is so nearly down.”</p>

<p>She turned and faced him, pale first with infinite
pleasure, and then rosy to the roots of her
flaxen hair.</p>

<p>“When did you come?” she asked eagerly.
“Have you been long in Italy?”</p>

<p>“I only came through the St. Gothard last
night, breakfasted at Locarno, and came here by
road. I have not seen Mrs. Greswold yet. She is
well, I hope?”</p>

<p>“She is not over-well. She frets dreadfully, I
am afraid. It is so sad that she and Uncle George
should be living apart for some mysterious reason
which nobody knows. They were the most perfect
couple.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Greswold is a perfect woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“And Uncle George has the finest character.
His first marriage was unhappy, I believe; nobody
ever talked about it. I think it was only just
known in the family that he had married in Italy
when he was a young man, and that his wife had
died within a year. It was supposed that she could
not have been nice, since nobody knew anything
about her.”</p>

<p>“Rather hard upon the dead lady to be condemned
by her husband’s silence. Will you take me to your
aunt?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure. I think she ought to be
charmed to see you, for we lead the most solitary
existence here. My aunt has set her face against
knowing anybody, in the hotel or out of it. And there
have been some really charming people staying
here; people one would go out of one’s way to know.
Have you come here for your health?”</p>

<p>“For my pleasure only. I was sick to death of
England and of cities. I longed to steep myself in
the infinite and the beautiful. Those indigo clouds
above the mountains yonder—with that bold splash
of orange shining through the gorge—are worth the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
journey, were there no more than that; and when the
wintry stars glass themselves in the lake by and by,
ah! then one knows what it is to be the living, acting
element in a world of passive beauty. And to think
that there are men and women in London groping
about in the fog, and fancying themselves alive!”</p>

<p>“O, but there are compensations—theatres,
concerts, dances.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ransome, I fear you are a Philistine.”</p>

<p>“O, no, no! I adore Nature. I should like to
be above those common earthly pleasures—to journey
from star to star along the planetary chain,
rising at each transition to a higher level, until I
came to the spirit world where— This is the
hotel, and we are on the second floor. Would you
like the lift?”</p>

<p>“I never walk when I can be carried.”</p>

<p>“Then we will go up in the lift. I used to think
it rather good fun at first,” said Pamela with a sigh,
remembering how soon that trivial excitement had
begun to pall.</p>

<p>Mildred received the unexpected visitor with
marked coldness; but it was not easy to remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
persistently cold while Pamela was so warm. Castellani
was one of those provoking people who refuse
to see when they are unwelcome. He was full of
talk, gay, bright, and varied. He had all the social
events of the past three months to talk about.
Society had witnessed the most extraordinary
changes—marriages—sudden deaths—everything
unlooked for. There had been scandals, too; but
these he touched upon lightly, and with a deprecating
air, professing himself sorry for everybody.</p>

<p>Mildred allowed him to talk, and was, perhaps,
a little more cordial when he took his leave than
she had been when he came. He had prevented
her from thinking her own thoughts for the space
of an hour, and that was something for which to be
grateful. He had come there in pursuit of Pamela,
no doubt. He could have no other reason. He had
been playing his own game, holding back in order to
be the more gladly accepted when he should declare
himself. It was thus Mildred reasoned with herself;
and yet there had been looks and tones which
it was difficult for her to forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“He is by profession a lady-killer,” she argued;
“no doubt he treats all women in the same way. He
cannot help trying to fascinate them; and there are
women like Cecilia Tomkison who encourage him to
make sentimental speeches.”</p>

<p>She persuaded herself that the looks and tones
which had offended meant very little. For Pamela’s
sake she would like to think well of him.</p>

<p>“You have told me about a great many
people,” she said, as he was leaving them, “but
you have told me nothing about my husband.
Did you hear if he was still at Enderby—and
well?”</p>

<p>“He was still at Enderby up to the end of
November, and I believe he was well. I spent three
days at Riverdale, and heard of him from Mrs. Hillersdon.”</p>

<p>Mildred asked no further question, nor did she
invite Mr. Castellani to repeat his visit. Happily
for his own success in life, he was not the kind of
person to wait for invitations.</p>

<p>“I am staying in the hotel,” he said. “I hope
I may drop in sometimes—to-morrow even. Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Ransome is good enough to say she would like to
sing some duets with me.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ransome knows I have not been receiving
any visitors,” Mildred answered, with a touch of
reproachfulness.</p>

<p>“O, but Mr. Castellani is an old friend! The
people you avoided were strangers,” said Pamela
eagerly.</p>

<p>Mildred made no further protest. Few men
would have accepted a permission so grudgingly
given; but Castellani stopped at no obstacle when
he had a serious purpose to serve: and in this case
his purpose was very serious; for life or death, he
told himself.</p>

<p>He came next day, and the day after that, and
every day for four or five weeks, till the first flush of
precocious spring lent beauty to the landscape and
softness to the sky. Mildred submitted to his
visits as an inevitable consequence of Pamela’s
folly; submitted, and by and by fell into the habit
of being amused by Castellani; interested in his talk
of men and women and of books, of which he seemed
to have read all of any mark that had ever been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
written. She allowed herself to be interested; she
allowed herself to be soothed by his music; she
let him become an influence in her life, unawares,
caught by a subtlety that had never been surpassed
by anybody of lesser gifts than Satan: but never did
this presumptuous wooer beguile her into one single
thought that wronged her absent husband. Her intellect
acknowledged the tempter’s intellectual sway,
but her heart knew no wavering.</p>

<p>César Castellani had seen a good deal of life, but
as he had assiduously cultivated the seamy side, it
was hardly strange if he lacked the power of understanding
a pure-minded woman. To his mind every
woman was a citadel, better or worse defended, but
always assailable by treason or strategy, force or art,
and never impregnable. Mrs. Greswold was his
Troy, his Thebes, his ideal of majesty and strength
in woman. So far as virtue went upon this earth
he believed Mildred Greswold to be virtuous; proud,
too; not a woman to lower her crest to the illicit
conqueror, or stain her name with the disgrace of a
runaway wife. But it had been given to him to
disturb a union that had existed happily for fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
years. It had been given to him to awaken
the baneful passion of jealousy, to sow the seeds of
suspicion, to part husband and wife. He had gone
to work carelessly enough in the first instance,
struck with Mildred’s beauty and sweetness—full of
sentimental recollections of the fair child-face and
the bright streaming hair that had passed him like
a vision in the sunlight of Hyde Park. He had
envied the husband so fair a wife, so luxurious a
home, with its air of old-world respectability, that
deep-rooted English aristocracy of landed estate,
which to the foreign adventurer seemed of all conditions
in life the most enviable. He had been impelled
by sheer malice when he uttered his careless
allusion to George Greswold’s past life, and with a
word blighted two hearts.</p>

<p>He saw the effect of the speech in the face of the
wife, and in the manner of the husband saw that he
had launched a thunderbolt. It was with deepest
interest he followed up his advantage; watched and
waited for further evidence of the evil he had done.
He was a close student of the faces of women; above
all, when the face was lovely. He saw all the marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
of secret care in Mrs. Greswold’s countenance during
the weeks that elapsed between his first visit to Enderby
and the charity concert. He saw the deepening
shadows, the growing grief, and on the day of the
concert he saw the traces of a still keener pain in
those pale features and haggard eyes; but for an
immediate separation between husband and wife he
was not prepared.</p>

<p>He heard at Riverdale of Mrs. Greswold’s departure
from home. The suddenness and strangeness
of her journey had set all the servants talking. He
found out where she had gone, and hastened at once
to call upon his devoted friend Mrs. Tomkison, who
told him all she had to tell.</p>

<p>“There is some domestic misery—an intrigue on
his part, I fear,” said the glib Cecilia. “Men are
such traitors. It would hardly surprise me to-morrow
if I was told that Adam was maintaining an
expensive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</i> in St. John’s Wood. She would
tell me nothing, poor darling; but she sent for Mr.
Cancellor, and was closeted with him for an hour.
No doubt she told <em>him</em> everything. And then she
went off to Brighton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Castellani followed to Brighton, and his influence
with Miss Fausset enabled him to learn something,
but not all. Not one word said Miss Fausset about
the supposed identity between George Greswold’s
first wife and John Fausset’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i>; but she told
Mr. Castellani that she feared her niece’s separation
from her husband would be permanent.</p>

<p>“Why does she not divorce him,” he asked, “if
he has wronged her?”</p>

<p>“He has not wronged her—in the way you mean.
And if he had, she could not divorce him, unless he
had beaten her. You men made the law, and framed
it in your own favour. It is a very sad case, César,
and I am not at liberty to say any more about it.
You must ask me no more questions.”</p>

<p>Castellani obeyed for the time being; but he did
ask further questions upon other occasions, and he
exercised all his subtlety in the endeavour to extract
information from Miss Fausset. That lady, however,
was inflexible; and he had to wait for time to
solve the mystery.</p>

<p>“They have parted on account of that first marriage,”
he told himself. “Perhaps she has found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
out all about the poor lady’s fate, and takes the worst
view of the catastrophe. That would account for
their separation. She would not stay with a husband
she suspected; he would not live with a wife
who could so suspect. A very pretty quarrel.”</p>

<p>A quarrel—a life-long severance—but not a
divorce. There was the difficulty. César Castellani
believed himself invincible with women. The
weakest, and in some cases the worst, of the sex had
educated him into the belief that no woman lived
who could resist him. And here was a woman whom
he intensely admired, and whose married life it had
been his privilege to wreck. She was a rich woman—and
it was essential to his success in life that he
should marry wealth. With all his various gifts he
was not a money-earning man, he would never attain
even lasting renown by his talents. For when the
good fairies had endowed him with music and poetry,
eloquence and grace, the strong-minded, hard-featured
fairy called Perseverance came to his christening
feast, and seeing no knife and fork laid for
her, doomed him to the curse of idleness. He had
all the talents which enable a man to shine in society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
but he had also the money-spending talent, the
elegant tastes and inclinations which require some
thousands a year for their sustenance. Hitherto he
had lived by his wits—from hand to mouth; but
for some years past he had been on the look-out for
a rich wife.</p>

<p>He knew that Mildred Greswold was three times
richer than Pamela Ramsome. The wealth of the
Faussets came within the region of his knowledge;
and he knew how large a fortune John Fausset had
left his daughter, and how entirely that fortune was
at her own disposal. He might have had Pamela for
the asking; Pamela, with a paltry fifteen hundred
a year; Pamela, who sang false and bored him
beyond measure. The higher prize seemed impossible;
but it was his nature to attempt the impossible.
His belief in his own power was boundless.</p>

<p>“She cannot divorce her husband,” he told himself;
“but he may divorce her if she should wrong
him, or even seem to wrong him: and the most innocent
woman may be compromised if her lover is daring
and will risk much for a great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>, as I would.”</p>

<p>He thought himself very near success in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
lengthening afternoons in the beginning of February,
when he was allowed to spend the lovely hour of
sundown in Mrs. Greswold’s <em>salon</em>, watching the
sunset from the wide plate-glass window, which commanded
a panorama of lake and mountain, with
every exquisite change from concentrated light to
suffused colour, and then to deepening purple that
slowly darkened into night. It was the hour in
which it was deemed dangerous to be out of doors;
but it was the loveliest hour of the day or the night,
and Mildred never wearied of that glorious outlook
over lake and sky. She was silent for the most part
at such a time, sitting in the shadow of the window-curtains,
her face hidden from the other two, sitting
apart from the world, thinking of the life that had
been and could never be again.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the midst of her sad thoughts Castellani
would strike a chord on the piano at the other
end of the room, and then a tender strain of melody
would steal out of the darkness, and that veiled
tenor voice would sing some of the saddest lines of
Heine, the poet of the broken heart, sadder than
Byron, sadder than Musset, sad with the sadness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
one who had never known joy. Those words wedded
to tenderest melody always moved Mildred Greswold
to tears. Castellani saw her tears and thought they
were given to him; such tears as yielding virtue
gives to the tempter. He knew the power of his
voice, the fascination of music for those in whom the
love of music is a part of their being. He could not
foresee the possibility of failure. He was already
admitted to that kind of intimacy which is the first
stage of success. He was an almost daily visitor;
he came upon the two ladies in their walks and drives,
and contrived, unbidden, to make himself their companion;
he chose the books that both were to read,
and made himself useful in getting library parcels
sent from Milan or Paris. He contrived to make
himself indispensable, or at least thought himself so.
Pamela’s eagerness filled up all the gaps; she was so
full of talk and vivacity that it was not easy to be
sure about the sentiments of her more silent companion;
but César Castellani’s vanity was the key
with which he read Mildred’s character and feelings.</p>

<p>“She is a sphinx,” he told himself; “but I
think I can solve her mystery. The magnetic power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of such a love as mine must draw her to me sooner
or later.”</p>

<p>Mr. Castellani had a profound belief in his own
magnetism. That word magnetic had a large place
in his particular creed. He talked of certain fascinating
women—generally a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passée</i>—as “magnetic.”
He prided himself upon being a magnetic
man.</p>

<p>While César Castellani flattered himself that he
was on the threshold of success, Mildred Greswold
was deliberating how best to escape from him and
his society for ever. Had she been alone there need
have been no difficulty; but she saw Pamela’s happiness
involved in his presence, she saw the fresh
young cheek pale at the thought of separation, and
she was perplexed how to act for the best. Had
Pamela been her daughter she could not have considered
her feelings more tenderly. She told herself
that Mr. Castellani would be a very bad match for
Miss Ransome; yet when she saw the girl’s face
grow radiant at the sound of his footsteps, when she
watched her dullness in his absence, that everlasting
air of waiting for somebody which marks the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
who is in love, she found herself hoping that the
Italian would make a formal proposal, and she was
inclined to meet him half-way.</p>

<p>But the new year was six weeks old, and he had
not even hinted at matrimonial intentions, so Mildred
felt constrained to speak plainly.</p>

<p>“My dearest Pamela, we are drifting into a very
uncomfortable position with Mr. Castellani,” she
began gently. “He comes here day after day as
if he were your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</i>, and yet he has said nothing
definite.”</p>

<p>Pamela grew crimson at this attack, and her
hands began to tremble over her crewel-work, though
she tried to go on working.</p>

<p>“I respect him all the more for being in no haste
to declare himself, Aunt Mildred,” she said, rather
angrily. “If he were the kind of adventurer you
once thought him, he would have made me an offer
ages ago. Why should he not come to see us? I’m
sure he’s very amusing and very useful. Even you
seem interested in him and cheered by him. Why
should he not come? We have no one’s opinion to
study in a foreign hotel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, dear. People always
hear about things; and it might injure you by and
by in society to have your name associated with Mr.
Castellani.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I should be very proud of it,” retorted
Pamela; “very proud to have my name
associated with genius.”</p>

<p>“And you really, honestly believe you could be
happy as his wife, Pamela?” asked Mildred gravely.</p>

<p>“I know that I can never be happy with any one
else. I don’t consider myself particularly clever,
aunt, but I believe I have the artistic temperament.
Life without art would be a howling wilderness for
me.”</p>

<p>“Life means a long time, dear. Think what a
difference it must make whether you lead it with a
good or a bad man!”</p>

<p>“All the goodness in the world would not make
me happy with a husband who was not musical; not
John Howard, nor John Wesley, nor John Bunyan,
nor any of your model Johns. John Milton <em>was</em>,”
added Pamela rather vaguely, “and handsome into
the bargain; but I’m afraid he was a little <em>dry</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Promise me at least this much, Pamela. First,
that you will take no step without your uncle’s knowledge
and advice; and next, that if ever you marry
Mr. Castellani, you will have your fortune strictly
settled upon yourself.”</p>

<p>“O, aunt, how sordid! But perhaps it would
be best. If I had the money, I should give it all to
him: but if he had the money, with his artistic temperament
he would be sure to lavish it all upon
other people. He would not be able to pass a picturesque
beggar without emptying his pockets. Do
you remember how he was impressed by the four
old men on the church steps the other day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t think he gave them anything.”</p>

<p>“Not while we were with him; but you may
be sure he did afterwards.”</p>

<p>After this conversation Mrs. Greswold made up
her mind on two points. She would arrange for a
prompt departure to Venice or Naples, whichever
might be advised for the spring season; and she
would sound Mr. Castellani as to his intentions. It
was not fair to Pamela that she should be kept in
the dark any longer, that the gentleman should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
allowed to sing duets with her, and advise her studies,
and join her in her walks, and yet give no definite
expression to his regard.</p>

<p>Mildred tried to think the best of him as a suitor
for her husband’s niece. She knew that he was
clever; she knew that he was fairly well born. On
his mother’s side he sprang from the respectable
commercial classes; on his father’s side he belonged
to the art-world. There was nothing debasing in
such a lineage. From neither her friend Mrs. Tomkison
nor from Miss Fausset had she heard anything
to his discredit; and both those ladies had known
him long. There could therefore be no objection
on the score of character. Pamela ought to make
a much better marriage in the way of means and
position; but those excellent and well-chosen alliances
dictated by the wisdom of friends are sometimes
known to result in evil; and, in a word, why
should not Pamela be happy in her own way?</p>

<p>Having thus reasoned with herself, Mildred
watched for an opportunity to speak to Castellani.
She had not long to wait. He called rather earlier
than usual one afternoon, when Pamela had gone out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
for a mountain ramble with her dog and her maid,
to search for those doubly precious flowers which
bloom with the first breath of spring. Castellani
had seen the young lady leave the hotel soon after
the midday meal, armed with her alpenstock, and
accompanied by her attendant carrying a basket.
She had fondly hoped that he would offer to join her
expedition, to dig out delicate ferns from sheltered
recesses, to hunt for mountain hyacinths and many-hued
anemones; but he observed her departure <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</i>
behind a window-curtain in the reading-room, and
half-an-hour afterwards he was ushered into Mrs.
Greswold’s drawing-room.</p>

<p>“I feared you were ill,” he said, “as I saw Miss
Ransome excursionising without you.”</p>

<p>“I have a slight headache, and felt more inclined
for a book than for a long walk. Why did you not
go with Pamela? I daresay she would have been
glad of your company. Peterson is not a lively companion
for a mountain ramble.”</p>

<p>“Poor Miss Ransome! How sad to be a young
English Mees, and to have to be chaperoned by a
person like Peterson!” said Castellani, with a careless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
shrug. “No, I had no inclination to join in
the anemone hunt. Miss Ransome told me yesterday
what she was going to do. I have no passion
for wild flowers or romantic walks.”</p>

<p>“But you seem to have a great liking for Miss
Ransome’s society,” replied Mildred gravely. “You
have cultivated it very assiduously since you came
here, and I think I may be excused for fancying that
you came to Pallanza on her account.”</p>

<p>“You may be excused for thinking anything
wild and improbable, because you are a woman and
wilfully blind,” he answered, drawing his chair a
little nearer to hers, and lowering his voice with a
touch of tenderness. “But surely—surely you cannot
think that I came to Pallanza on Miss Ransome’s
account?”</p>

<p>“I might not have thought so had you been a
less frequent visitor in this room, where you have
come—pardon me for saying so—very much of your
own accord. I don’t think it was quite delicate or
honourable to come here so often, to be so continually
in the society of a frank, impressionable girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
unless you had some deeper feeling for her than
casual admiration.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Greswold, upon my honour I have never
in the whole course of my acquaintance with Miss
Ransome by one word or tone implied any warmer
feeling than that which you call casual admiration.”</p>

<p>“And you are not attached to her? you do not
cherish the hope of winning her for your wife?”
asked Mildred seriously, looking at him with earnest
eyes.</p>

<p>That calm, grave look chilled him to the core of
his heart. His brow flushed, his eyes grew dark
and troubled. He felt as if the crisis of his life
were approaching, and augury was unfavourable.</p>

<p>“I have never cherished any such hope; I never
shall.”</p>

<p>“Then why have you come here so continually?”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, do not ask me that question!
The time has not come.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Castellani, the time has come. The
question should have been asked sooner. You have
compromised Miss Ransome by your meaningless
assiduities. You have compromised me; for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
ought to have taken better care of her than to allow
an acquaintance of so ambiguous a character. But
I am very glad that I have spoken, and that you
have replied plainly. From to-day your visits must
cease. We shall go to the south of Italy in a few
days. Let me beg that you will not happen to be
travelling in the same direction.”</p>

<p>Mildred was deeply indignant. She had cheapened
her husband’s niece—Randolph Ransome’s
co-heiress—a girl whom half the young men in
London would have considered a prize in the matrimonial
market: and this man, who had haunted
her at home and abroad for the last seven or eight
weeks, dared now to tell her that his attentions
were motiveless so far as her niece was concerned.</p>

<p>“O, Mildred, do not banish me!” he cried passionately.
“You must have understood. You must
know that it is you, and you only, for whom I care;
you whose presence makes life lovely for me, in whose
absence I am lost and wretched. You have wrung
my secret from me. I did not mean to offend. I
would have respected your strange widowhood. I
would have waited half a lifetime. Only to see you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
to be near you—your slave, your proud, too happy
slave. That was all I would have asked. Why
may that not be? Why may I not come and go,
like the summer wind that breathes round you, like
the flowers that look in at your window—faithful as
your dog, patient as old Time? Why may it not
be, Mildred?”</p>

<p>She stood up suddenly before him, white to the
lips, and with cold contempt in those eyes which he
had seen so lovely with the light of affection when
they had looked at her husband. She looked at him
unfalteringly, as she might have looked at a worm.
Anger had made her pale, but that was all.</p>

<p>“You must have had a strange experience of
women before you would dare to talk to any honest
woman in such a strain as this, Mr. Castellani,” she
said. “I will not lower myself so far as to tell you
what I think of your conduct. Miss Ransome shall
know the kind of person whose society she has
endured. I must beg that you will consider yourself
as much a stranger to her as to me from to-day.”</p>

<p>She moved towards the bell, but he intercepted
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“You are very cruel,” he said; “but the day
will come when you will be sorry that you rejected
the most devoted love that was ever offered to woman,
in order to be true to broken bonds.”</p>

<p>“They are not broken. They will hold me to
my dying hour.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to a madman and a murderer.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Mildred</span> stood speechless for some moments after
those words of Castellani’s, looking at him with
kindling eyes.</p>

<p>“How dare you?” she cried at last. “How dare
you accuse my husband—the noblest of men?”</p>

<p>“The noblest of men do strange things sometimes
upon an evil impulse, and when they are not
quite right here,” touching his forehead.</p>

<p>“My husband, George Greswold, is too high a
mark for your malignity. Do you think you can
make me believe evil of him after fourteen years of
married life? His intellect is the clearest and the
soundest I have ever found in man or woman. You
can no more shake my faith in his power of brain
than in his goodness of heart.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. The George Greswold you know
is a gentleman of commanding intellect and unblemished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
character. But the George Ransome whom I
knew seventeen years ago was a gentleman who was
shrewdly suspected of having made away with his
wife; and who was confined in a public asylum in
the environs of Nice as a dangerous lunatic. If you
doubt these facts, you have only to go to Nice, or to
St. Jean, where Mr. Ransome and his wife lived for
some time in a turtle-dove retirement, which ended
tragically. Seventeen years does not obliterate the
evidence of such a tragedy as that in which your
husband was chief actor.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe one word—and I hope I may
never hear your voice again,” said Mildred, with her
hand on the electric bell.</p>

<p>She did not remove her hand till her servant, the
courier, opened the door. A look told him his
duty. Castellani took up his hat without a word;
and Albrecht deferentially attended him to the landing,
and politely whistled for the lift to convey him
to the vestibule below.</p>

<p>Castellani made the descent, feeling like Lucifer
when he fell from heaven.</p>

<p>“Too soon!” he muttered to himself. “She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
took the cards out of my hands—she forced my play,
and spoiled my game. But I have given her something
to think about. She will not forget to-day’s
interview in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Albrecht, the handiest of men, was standing
beside him, working the lift.</p>

<p>“Where is your next move to be, Albrecht?” he
asked in German.</p>

<p>The noble-born lady had not yet decided, Albrecht
told him; but he thought the move would be either
to Venice or to Posilippo.</p>

<p>“If I pretended to be a prophet, Albrecht, I
should tell thee that the honourable lady will go to
neither Venice nor Posilippo; but that thy next
move will be to the Riviera, perhaps to Nice.”</p>

<p>Albrecht shrugged his shoulders in polite indifference.</p>

<p>“Look here, my friend, come thou to me when
madame gives the order for Nice, and I will give
thee a louis for assuring me that I prophesied right,”
said Castellani, as he stepped out of the lift.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mildred walked up and down the room, trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
control the confusion of her thoughts, trying to
reason calmly upon that hideous accusation which
she had affected to despise, but which yet had struck
terror to her soul. Would he dare to bring such a
charge—villain and traitor as he was—if there were
not some ground for the accusation, some glimmer
of truth amidst a cloud of falsehood?</p>

<p>And her husband’s manner: his refusal to tell
her the history of his first marriage; his reticence,
his secrecy—reticence so out of harmony with his
boldly truthful nature; the gloom upon his face
when she forced him to speak of that past life: all
these things came back upon her with appalling
force, and even trifles assumed a direful significance.</p>

<p>“O, my beloved! <em>what</em> was that dark story, and
why did you leave me to hear it from such false lips
as those?”</p>

<p>And then with passionate tears she thought how
easy it would have been to forgive and pity even a
tale of guilt—unpremeditated guilt, doubtless, fatality
rather than crime—if her husband had laid his
weary head upon her breast and told her all; holding
back nothing; confident in the strength of a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
love to understand and to pardon. How much
easier would it have been to bear the burden of a
guilty secret, so shared, in the supreme trustfulness
of her husband’s love! How light a burden compared
with this which was laid upon her! this horror
of groping backward into the black night of the past.</p>

<p>“I must know the worst,” she said to herself;
“I will test that scoundrel’s accusation. I must
know all. I will take no step to injure my dear
love. I will seek no help, trust no friend. I must
act alone.”</p>

<p>Then came a more agonising thought of the hapless
wife—the victim.</p>

<p>“My sister! What was your fate? I <em>must</em>
know.”</p>

<p>Her thoughts came back always to that point—“I
must know all.”</p>

<p>She recalled the image of that unacknowledged
sister, the face bending over her bed when she started
up out of a feverish dream, frightened and in tears,
to take instant comfort from that loving presence, to
fling her arms round Fay’s neck, and nestle upon
her bosom. Never had that sisterly love failed her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
The quiet watcher was always near. A sigh, a
faint little murmur, and the volunteer nurse was at
her side. Often on waking she had found Fay sitting
by her bed, in the dead of the night, motionless
and watchful, sleepless from loving care.</p>

<p>Her love for Fay had been one of the strongest
feelings of her life. She, who had been ever dutiful
to the frivolous, capricious mother, had yet unconsciously
given a stronger affection to the companion
who had loved her with an unselfish love, which the
mother had never shown. Her regard for Fay
had been the one romance of her childhood, and had
continued the strongest sentiment of her mind until
the hour when, for the first time, she knew the
deeper love of womanhood, and gave her heart to
George Greswold.</p>

<p>And now these two supreme affections rose up
before her in dreadful conflict; and in the sister so
faithfully loved and so fondly regretted she saw the
victim of her still dearer husband.</p>

<p>Pamela’s footsteps and Pamela’s voice in the
corridor startled her in the midst of those dark
thoughts. She hurriedly withdrew to her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
room, where the maid Louisa was sitting, intent
upon one of those infinitesimal repairs which served
as an excuse for her existence.</p>

<p>“Go and tell Miss Ransome that I cannot dine
with her. My headache is worse than it was when
she went out. Ask her to excuse me.”</p>

<p>Louisa obeyed, and Mildred locked the door upon
her grief. She sat all through the long evening
brooding over the past and the future, impatient to
know the worst.</p>

<p>She was on her way to Genoa with Pamela and
their attendants before the following noon. Albrecht,
the courier, had scarcely time to claim the promised
coin from Mr. Castellani.</p>

<p>Miss Ransome repined at this sudden departure.</p>

<p>“Just as we were going to be engaged,” she
sobbed, when she and Mildred were alone in a railway
compartment. “It is really unkind of you to
whisk one off in such a way, aunt.”</p>

<p>“My dear Pamela, you have had a lucky
escape; and I hope you will never mention Mr.
Castellani’s name again. He is an utterly bad
man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“How cruel to say such a thing!—behind his
back, too! What has he done that is bad, I should
like to know?”</p>

<p>“I cannot enter into details; but I can tell you
one thing, Pamela: he has never had any idea of
asking you to be his wife. He told me that in the
plainest language.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you questioned him
about his feelings—for me?”</p>

<p>“I did what I felt was my duty, Pamela—my
duty to you and to your uncle.”</p>

<p>“Duty!” ejaculated Pamela, with such an air
that Box began to growl, imagining his mistress in
want of protection. “Duty! It is the most hateful
word in the whole of the English language. You
asked him when he was going to propose to me—you
lowered and humiliated me beyond all that words
can say—you—you spoilt everything.”</p>

<p>“Pamela, is this reasonable or just?”</p>

<p>“To be asked when he was going to propose to
a girl—with his artistic temperament—the very
thing to disgust him,” said Pamela, in a series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
gasps. “If you had <span class="allsmcap">WANTED</span> to part us for ever you
could not have gone to work better.”</p>

<p>“Whatever I wanted yesterday, I am quite clear
about my feelings to-day, Pamela. It is my earnest
hope that you and Mr. Castellani will never meet
again.”</p>

<p>“You are very cruel, then—heartless—inhuman.
Because <em>you</em> have done with love—because you have
left my poor Uncle George—Heaven alone knows why—is
no one else to be happy?”</p>

<p>“You could not be happy with César Castellani,
Pamela. Happiness does not lie that way. I tell
you again, he is a bad man.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you again I don’t believe you. In
what way is he bad? Does he rob, murder, forge,
set fire to people’s houses? What has he done
that is bad?”</p>

<p>“He has traduced your uncle—to me, his wife.”</p>

<p>Pamela’s countenance fell.</p>

<p>“You—you may have misunderstood him,” she
faltered.</p>

<p>“No, there was no possibility of mistake. He
slandered my husband. He let me see in the plainest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
way that he had no real regard for you, that he
did not care how far his frequent visits compromised
either you or me. He is utterly base, Pamela—a
man without rectitude or conscience. He would
have clung to us like some poisonous burr if I had
not shaken him off. My dear, dear child,” said
Mildred, putting her arm round Pamela’s reluctant
waist, and drawing the girlish figure nearer to her
side, to the relief of Box, who leaped upon their
shoulders and licked their faces in a rapture of
sympathetic feeling; “my dear, you have been
treated very badly, but I am not to blame. You
have had a lucky escape, Pamela. Why be angry
about it?”</p>

<p>“It is all very well to talk like that,” sighed the
girl, wrinkling her white forehead in painful perplexity.
“He was my day-dream. One cannot
renounce one’s day-dream at a moment’s warning.
If you knew the castles I have built—a life spent
with him—a life devoted to the cultivation of art!
He would have <em>made</em> my voice; and we could
have had a flat in Queen Anne’s Mansions, and
a brougham and victoria, and lived within our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
income,” concluded Pamela, following her own train
of thought.</p>

<p>“My dearest, there are so many worthier to
share your life. You will have new day-dreams.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps when I am sixty. It will take me a
lifetime to forget him. Do you think I could marry
a country bumpkin, or any one who was not artistic?”</p>

<p>“You shall not be asked to marry a rustic. The
artistic temperament is common enough nowadays.
Almost every one is artistic.”</p>

<p>Pamela shrugged her shoulders petulantly, and
turned to the window in token that she had said her
say. She grieved like a child who has been disappointed
of some jaunt looked forward to for long
days of expectation. She tried to think herself ill-used
by her uncle’s wife; and yet that common
sense of which she possessed a considerable share
told her that she had only herself to blame. She
had chosen to fall in love with a showy, versatile
adventurer, without waiting for evidence that he
cared for her. Proud in the strength of her position
as an independent young woman with a handsome
fortune and a fairly attractive person, she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
imagined that Mr. Castellani could look no higher,
hope for nothing better than to obtain her hand and
heart. She had ascribed his reticence to delicacy.
She had accepted his frequent visits as an evidence
of his attachment and of his ulterior views.</p>

<p>And now she sat in a sulky attitude, coiled up
in a corner of the carriage, with her face to the
window, meditating upon her fool’s paradise. For
seven happy weeks she had seen the man she admired
almost daily; and her own intense sympathy with
him had made her imagine an equal sympathy on
his part. When their hands touched the thrilling
vibration seemed mutual; and yet it had been on
her side only, poor fool, she told herself now, abased
in her own self-consciousness, drinking the cup of
humiliation to the dregs.</p>

<p>He had slandered her uncle—yes, that was
villany, that was iniquity. She began to think that
he was utterly black. She remembered how coldly
cruel he had been about the anemone hunt yesterday;
how deaf to her girlish hints; never offering his
company: colder, crueller than marble. She felt as
if she had squandered her love upon Satan. Yet she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
was not the less angry with Mildred. That kind of
interference was unpardonable.</p>

<p>She arrived at Genoa worn out with a fatiguing
journey, and in a worse temper than she had ever
sustained for so long a period, she whose worst
tempers hitherto had been like April showers.
Mildred had reciprocated her silence, and Box had
been the only animated passenger.</p>

<p>The clever courier had made all his arrangements
by telegraph: they spent a night at Genoa; drove
round the city next morning; explored churches,
palaces, and picture-galleries; and went on to Nice in
the afternoon. They arrived at the great bustling
station late in the evening, and were driven to one
of the hotels on the Promenade des Anglais, where
all preparations had been made for their reception:
a glowing hearth in a spacious drawing-room opening
on to a balcony, lamps and candles lighted,
roses on all the tables, maid and man on the alert to
receive travellers of distinction. So far as a place
which is not home can put on an aspect of homeliness
the hotel had succeeded; but Mildred looked
round upon the white and gold walls, and the satin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
fauteuils, with an aching heart, remembering those
old rooms at Enderby, and the familiar presence
that had first made them dear to her, before the
habit of years had made those inanimate things a
part of her life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She was at Nice; she had taken the slanderer’s
advice, and had gone to the city by the sea, to try
and trace out for herself the mystery of the past,
to violate her husband’s secret, kept so long and so
closely, only to rise up after years of happiness, like
a murdered corpse exhumed from a forgotten grave.</p>

<p>She was here, on the scene of her husband’s
first marriage, and for three or four days she walked
and drove about the strange busy place aimlessly,
hopelessly, no nearer the knowledge of that dark
history than she had been at Enderby Manor. Not
for worlds would she injure the man she loved.
She wanted to know all; but the knowledge must
be obtained in such a way as could not harm him.
This necessitated diplomacy, which was foreign to
her nature, and patience, in which womanly quality
she excelled. She had learnt patience in her tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
ministrations to a fretful invalid, during those sad
slow years in which pretty Mrs. Fausset had faded
into the grave. Yes, she had learnt to be patient,
and to submit to sorrow. She knew how to wait.</p>

<p>The place, delightful as it was in the early
spring weather, possessed no charms for her. Its
gaiety and movement jarred upon her. The sunsets
were as lovely here as at Pallanza, and
her only pleasure was to watch that ever-varying
splendour of declining day behind the long dark
promontory of Antibes; or to see the morning dawn
in a flush of colour above the white lighthouse
yonder at the point of the peninsula of St. Jean.
It was in the village of St. Jean that George Greswold
had lived with his first wife—with Fay. The bright
face, pale, yet brilliant, a face in which light took
the place of colour; the eager eyes; the small sharp
features and thin sarcastic lips, rose up before her
with the thought of that union. He must have
loved her. She was so bright, so interesting, so
full of vivid fancies and changeful emotions. To
this hour Mildred remembered her fascination, her
power over a child’s heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>Pamela was dull and out of spirits. Not all the
Tauchnitz novels in Galignani’s shop could interest
her. She pronounced Nice distinctly inferior to
Brighton; declined even the distraction of the opera.</p>

<p>“Music would only make me miserable,” she
exclaimed petulantly. “I wish I might never hear
any again. That hateful band in the gardens tortures
me every morning.”</p>

<p>This was not hopeful. Mildred was sorry for
her, but too deeply absorbed by her own griefs to be
altogether sympathetic.</p>

<p>“She will find some one else to admire before
long,” she thought somewhat bitterly. “Girls who
fall in love so easily are easily consoled.”</p>

<p>She had been at Nice more than a week, and had
made no effort—yearning to know more—to know all—yet
dreading every new revelation. She had to
goad herself to action, to struggle against the weight
of a great fear—the fear that she might find the
slanderer’s accusations confirmed instead of being
refuted.</p>

<p>Her first step was a very simple one, easy
enough from a social point of view. Among old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Lady Castle-Connell’s intimate friends had been a
certain Irish chieftain called The O’Labacolly. The
O’Labacolly’s daughter had been one of the
reigning beauties of Dublin Castle, had appeared
for three seasons in London with considerable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>,
and in due course had married a Scotch peer, who
was lord of an extensive territory in the Highlands,
strictly entailed, and of a more profitable estate in
the neighbourhood of Glasgow at his own disposal.
Lord Lochinvar had been laid at rest in the sepulchre
of his forebears, and Lady Lochinvar was a
rich widow, still handsome, and still young enough
to enjoy all the pleasures of society. She had no
children of her own, but she had a favourite nephew,
whom she had adopted, and who acted as her escort
in her travels, which were extensive, and as her
steward in the management of the Glasgow property,
which had been settled upon her at her marriage.
The Highland territory had gone with the title
to a distant cousin of Lady Lochinvar’s husband.</p>

<p>Mildred remembered that Castellani had spoken
of meeting Mr. Ransome and his wife at Lady
Lochinvar’s palace at Nice. Her first step, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
was to make herself known to Lady Lochinvar,
who had wintered in this fair white city ever since
she came there as a young widow twenty years ago,
and had bought for herself a fantastic villa, built
early in the century by an Italian prince, on the
crest of a hill commanding the harbour.</p>

<p>With this view she wrote to Lady Lochinvar,
recalling the old friendship between The O’Labacolly
and Lady Castle-Connell, and introducing herself
on the strength of that friendship. Lady
Lochinvar responded with Hibernian warmth. She
called at the Hôtel Westminster that afternoon, and
not finding Mrs. Greswold at home, left a note
inviting her to lunch at the Palais Montano next
day.</p>

<p>Mildred promptly accepted the invitation. She
was anxious to be alone with Lady Lochinvar, and
there seemed a better chance of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à tête</i> at the
lady’s house than at the hotel, where it would have
been difficult to exclude Pamela. She drove to that
fair hill on the eastward side of the city, turning
her back upon the quaint old Italian town, with its
narrow streets of tall white houses with red roofs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
and its Cathedral dome embedded in the midst, the
red and yellow tiles glistening in the sunlight. The
two small horses toiled slowly up the height with
the great lumbering landau, carrying Mildred nearer
and nearer to the bright blue sky and the snow-line
glittering on the edge of the distant hills. They
went past villas and flower-gardens, hedges of yellow
roses and hedges of coral-hued geranium, cactus
and agave, palms and orange-trees, shining majolica
tubs and white marble balustrades, statues and
fountains, oriel windows and Italian cupolas, turrets
and towers of every order; while the sapphire sea
dropped lower and lower beneath the chalky winding
road, as the jutting promontory that shelters
Villefranche from the east came nearer and nearer
above the blue.</p>

<p>The Italian prince who built the Palais Montano
had aspired after Oriental rather than classic beauty.
His house was long and low, with two ranges of
Moorish windows, and a dome at each end. There
was an open loggia on the first floor, with a balustrade
of white and coloured marble; there was a
gallery above the spacious tesselated hall, screened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
by carved sandal-wood lattices, behind which the
beauties of a harem might be supposed to watch the
entrances and exits below. The house was fantastic,
but fascinating. The garden was the growth
of more than half a century, and was supremely
beautiful.</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar received the stranger with a
cordiality which would have set Mildred thoroughly
at her ease under happier circumstances. As it
was, she was too completely engrossed by the object
of her visit to feel any of that shyness which a person
of retiring disposition might experience on such
an occasion. She was grave and preoccupied, and
it was with an effort that she responded to Lady
Lochinvar’s allusions to the past.</p>

<p>“Your mother and I were girls together,” said
the Dowager, “at dear old Castle-Connell. My
father’s place was within a drive of the Castle, but
away from the river, and one of my first pleasant
memories is of your grandfather’s gardens and the
broad, bright Shannon. What a river! When I
look at our stony torrent-beds here, and remember
that glorious Shannon!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Yet you like Nice better than county Limerick?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, my dear Mrs. Greswold. Ireland
is a delicious country—to remember. I saw a
good deal of your mother in London before his lordship’s
death, but after I became a widow, I went
very little into English society. I had found English
people so narrow-minded. I only endured
them for Lochinvar’s sake; and after his death I
became a rover. I have an apartment in the
Champs Elysées and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied-à-terre</i> in Rome; and
now and then, when I want to drink a draught of
commonplace, when I want to know what the hard-headed,
practical British intellect is making of the
world in general, I give myself a fortnight at Claridge’s.
A fortnight is always enough. So, you
see, I have had no opportunity of looking up old
friends.”</p>

<p>“I never remember seeing you in Upper Parchment
Street,” said Mildred.</p>

<p>“My dear, you were a baby at the time I knew
your mother. I think you were just able to toddle
across the drawing-room the day I bade her good-bye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
before I went to Scotland with Lochinvar—our
last journey, poor dear man. He died the following
winter.”</p>

<p>The butler announced luncheon, and they went into
an ideal dining-room, purely Oriental, with hangings
of a dull pale pink damask interwoven with lustreless
gold, its only ornaments old Rhodes salvers
shining with prismatic hues, its furniture of cedar
inlaid with ivory.</p>

<p>“I am quite alone to-day,” said Lady Lochinvar.
“My nephew is driving to Monte Carlo by the
Cornice, and will not be back till dinner-time.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to be alone with you, Lady
Lochinvar. I feel myself bound to tell you that I
had an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrière-pensée</i> in seeking your acquaintance,
pleasant as it is to me to meet any friend of my
mother’s youth.”</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar looked surprised, and even a
little suspicious. She began to fear some uncomfortable
story. This sad-looking woman—such a
beautiful face, but with such unmistakable signs of
unhappiness. A runaway wife, perhaps; a poor
creature who had fallen into disgrace, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
wanted Lady Lochinvar’s help to regain her position,
or face her calumniators. Some awkward business,
no doubt. Lady Lochinvar was generous to a fault,
but she liked showing kindness to happy people, she
wanted smiling faces and serenity about her. She
had never known any troubles of her own, worse
than losing the husband whom she had married for
his wealth and position, and saw no reason why she
should be plagued with the troubles of other people.
Her handsome countenance hardened ever so little
as she answered,</p>

<p>“If there is any small matter in which I can be
of service to you—” she began.</p>

<p>“It is not a small matter; it is a great matter—to—to
a friend of mine,” interrupted Mildred,
faltering a little in her first attempt at dissimulation.</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar breathed more freely.</p>

<p>“I shall be charmed to help your friend if I
can.”</p>

<p>The butler came in and out, assisted by another
servant, as the conversation went on; but as his
mistress spoke to him and to his subordinate only
in Italian, Mildred concluded they understood very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
little English, and did not concern herself about
their presence.</p>

<p>“I want you to help me with your recollection
of the past, Lady Lochinvar. You were at Nice
seventeen years ago, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Between November and April, yes. I have
spent those months here for the last twenty
years.”</p>

<p>“You remember a Mr. Ransome and his wife,
seventeen years ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember them distinctly. I cannot
help remembering them.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever met Mr. Ransome since that
time?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“And you have not heard anything about him?”</p>

<p>“No, I have never heard of him since he left
the asylum on the road to St. André. Good
heavens, Mrs. Greswold, how white you have turned!
Pietro, some brandy this moment—”</p>

<p>“No, no! I am quite well—only a little
shocked, that is all. I had heard that Mr. Ransome
was out of his mind at one time, but I did not believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
my informant. It is really true, then? He
was once mad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was mad; unless it was all a sham, a
clever assumption.”</p>

<p>“Why should he have assumed madness?”</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar shrugged her portly shoulders,
and lifted her finely-arched eyebrows with a little
foreign air which had grown upon her in foreign
society.</p>

<p>“To escape from a very awkward dilemma. He
was arrested on suspicion of having killed his wife.
The evidence against him was weak, but the circumstances
of the poor thing’s death were very
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“How did she die?”</p>

<p>“She threw herself—or she was thrown—from a
cliff on the other side of the promontory which you
may see from that window.”</p>

<p>Mildred was silent for some moments, while her
breath came and went in hurried gasps.</p>

<p>“Might she not have fallen accidentally?” she
faltered.</p>

<p>“That would have been hardly possible. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
a place where she had been in the habit of walking
for weeks—a path which anybody might walk
upon in the daylight without the slightest danger.
And the calamity happened in broad day. She could
not have fallen accidentally. Either she threw herself
over, or he pushed her over in a moment of ungovernable
anger. She was a very provoking woman,
and had a tongue which might goad a man to fury.
I saw a good deal of her the winter before her death.
She was remarkably clever, and she amused me.
I had a kind of liking for her, and I used to let her
tell me her troubles.”</p>

<p>“What kind of troubles?”</p>

<p>“O, they all began and ended in one subject.
She was jealous, intolerably jealous, of her husband;
suspected him of inconstancy to herself if he was
commonly civil to a handsome woman. She watched
him like a lynx, and did her utmost to make his life
a burden to him, yet loved him passionately all the
time in her vehement, wrong-headed manner.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl! poor girl!” murmured Mildred,
with a stifled sob, and then she asked with intense
earnestness, “but, Lady Lochinvar, you who knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
George Ransome, surely <em>you</em> never suspected him
of murder?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mrs. Greswold. I believe he
was a gentleman, and a man of an open, generous
nature; but, upon my word, I should be sorry to
pledge myself to a positive belief in his innocence as
to his wife’s death. Who can tell what a man might
do, harassed and tormented as that man may have
been by that woman’s tongue? I know what pestilential
things she could say—what scorpions and
adders dropped out of her mouth when she was in
her jealous fits—and she may have gone just one
step too far—walking by his side upon that narrow
path—and he may have turned upon her, exasperated
to madness, and—one push—and the thing was
done. The edge of a cliff must be an awful temptation
under such circumstances,” added Lady Lochinvar
solemnly. “I am sure I would not answer for
myself in such a situation.”</p>

<p>“I will answer for <em>him</em>,” said Mildred firmly.</p>

<p>“You know him, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Where is he? What is he doing? Has he
prospered in life?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no. He was a happy man—or seemed
to be happy—for thirteen years of married life; and
then God’s hand was stretched out to afflict him,
and his only child was snatched away.”</p>

<p>“He married again, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he married a second wife fourteen years
ago. Forgive me, Lady Lochinvar, for having suppressed
the truth till now. I wanted you to answer
me more freely than you might have done had you
known all. George Ransome is my husband; he
assumed the name of Greswold when he succeeded
to his mother’s property.”</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Greswold, your husband, is my old
acquaintance. Is he with you here?”</p>

<p>“No. I have left him—perhaps for ever.”</p>

<p>“On account of that past story?”</p>

<p>“No, for another reason, which is my sad secret,
and his—a family secret. It involves no blame to
him or me. It is a dismal fatality which parts us.
You cannot suppose, Lady Lochinvar, that <em>I</em> could
think my husband a murderer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“A murderer? No! I do not believe any one ever
thought him guilty of deliberate murder—but that
he lost his temper with that unhappy girl, spurned
her from him, flung her over the edge of the cliff—”</p>

<p>“O, no, no, no! it is not possible! I know him
too well. He is not capable of a brutal act even
under the utmost exasperation. No irritation, no
sense of injury, could bring about such a change in
his nature. Think, Lady Lochinvar. I have been
his wife for fourteen years. I must know what his
character is like.”</p>

<p>“You know what he is in happy circumstances,
with an attached and confiding wife. You cannot
imagine him goaded to madness by an unreasonable,
hot-headed woman. You remember he was mad
for half a year after his wife’s death. There
must have been some sufficient reason for his madness.”</p>

<p>“His wife’s wretched death, and the fact that he
was accused of having murdered her, were enough
to make him mad.”</p>

<p>And then Mildred remembered how she had tortured
her husband by her persistent questions about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
that terrible past; how, in her jealousy of an unknown
rival, she, too, had goaded him almost as that
first wife had goaded him. She recalled the look of
pain, the mute protest against her cruelty, and she
hated herself for the selfishness of her love.</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar was kind and sympathetic. She
was not angry at the trap that had been set for her.</p>

<p>“I can understand,” she said. “You wanted to
know the worst, and you felt that I should be reticent
if I knew you were Mr. Ransome’s wife. Well, I
have said all the evil I can say about him. Remember
I know nothing except what other people thought
and suspected. There was an inquiry about the
poor thing’s death before the Juge d’Instruction at
Villefranche, and Mr. Ransome was kept in prison
between the first and second inquiry, and then it
was discovered that the poor fellow had gone off his
head, and he was taken to the asylum. He had no
relations in the neighbourhood, nobody interested in
looking after him. His acquaintances in Nice knew
very little about him or his wife, even when they
were living at an hotel on the Promenade des Anglais
and going into society. After they left Nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
they lived in seclusion at St. Jean, and avoided all
their acquaintance. Mrs. Ransome’s health was a
reason for retirement; but it may not have been the
only reason. There was no one, therefore, to look
after the poor man in his misfortunes. He was just
hustled away to the madhouse—the inquiry fell
through for want of evidence—and for six months
George Ransome was buried alive. I was in Paris
at the time, and only heard the story when I came
back to Nice in the following November. Nobody
could tell me what had become of Mr. Ransome, and
it was only by accident that I heard of his confinement
in the asylum some time after he had been
released as a sane man.”</p>

<p>“Did his wife ever talk to you of her own history?”</p>

<p>“Never. She was very fond of talking to me
about her husband’s supposed inconstancy and the
mistake she had made in marrying a man who had
never cared for her; but about her own people and
her own antecedents she was silent as the grave. In
a place like Nice, where everybody is idle, there is
sure to be a good deal of gossip, and we all had our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
own ideas about Mrs. Ransome. We put her down
as the natural daughter of some person of importance,
or, at any rate, of good means. She had her
own fortune, and was entirely independent of her
husband, who was not a rich man at that time.”</p>

<p>“No, it was his mother’s death that made him
rich. But you did not think he had married for
money?”</p>

<p>“No; our theory was that he had been worried
into marrying her. We thought the lady had thrown
herself at his head, and that all her unhappiness
sprang from her knowledge that she had in a measure
forced him to marry her.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the name of the house at St.
Jean where they lived when they left Nice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I called there once, but as Mrs. Ransome
never returned my call, I concluded that they wished
to drop their Nice acquaintance, and I heard afterwards
that they were living like hermits in a cave.
The house is a low white villa, spread out along the
edge of a grassy ridge, with a broad stone terrace on
one side and a garden and orchard on the other. It
is called Le Bout du Monde.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“I am very grateful to you, Lady Lochinvar, for
having been frank with me. I will go and look at
the house where they lived. I may find some one,
perhaps, who knew them.”</p>

<p>“You want to make further inquiries?”</p>

<p>“I want to find some one who is as convinced of
my husband’s guiltlessness as I am.”</p>

<p>“That will be difficult. There was very little
evidence for or against him. The husband and wife
went out to walk together one April afternoon. They
left the house in peace and amity, as it seemed to
their servants; but some ladies who met and talked
to them an hour afterwards thought by Mrs. Ransome’s
manner that she was on bad terms with her
husband. When she was next seen she was lying
at the foot of a cliff, dead. That is all that is known
of the tragedy. You could hardly hang a man or
acquit him upon such evidence. It is a case of not
proven.”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Lady Lochinvar</span> offered to drive Mrs. Greswold
to St. Jean that afternoon. Her villa was half-way
between Nice and Villefranche, and half-an-hour’s
drive would have taken them to the Bout du Monde;
but Mildred preferred to make her explorations
alone. There was too much heart-ache in such an
investigation to admit of sympathy or companionship.</p>

<p>“You are all goodness to me, dear Lady Lochinvar,”
she said, “and I may come to you again for
help before I have done; but I would rather visit the
scene of my husband’s tragedy alone—quite alone.
You cannot tell how sad the story is to me, even
apart from my love for him. I may be able to confide
in you more fully some day, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar kissed her at parting. She did
not care for commonplace troubles; she could not
sympathise with stupid family quarrels or shortness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
of money, or any of the vulgar trivialities about
which people worry their friends; but a romantic
sorrow, a tragedy with a touch of mystery in it, was
full of interest for her. And then, Mildred was a
graceful sufferer, not hysterical or tiresome in any
way.</p>

<p>“I will do anything in the world that I can for
you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Will you let me bring my husband’s niece
to see you?” asked Mildred. “She has a dull
time with me, poor girl, and I think you would like
her.”</p>

<p>“She shall come to me this evening, if she has
nothing better to do,” said Lady Lochinvar. “I
am fond of young people, and will do my best
to amuse her. I will send my carriage for her
at half-past seven.”</p>

<p>“That is more than kind. I shall be glad for
the poor girl to get a glimpse of something brighter
than our perpetual <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>. But there is one
thing I ought to speak about before you see her. I
think you know something of an Italian called
Castellani, a man who is both musical and literary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of Mr. Castellani’s growing
fame. He is the author of that delightful story
<em>Nepenthe</em>, is he not? I knew him years ago—it was
in the same winter we have been talking about. He
used to come to my parties. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“He has been a visitor at Enderby—my husband’s
house—and I have seen something of him
in Italy of late. I am sorry to say he has made
a very strong impression upon my niece’s heart—or
upon her imagination—but as I know him to be a
worthless person, I am deeply anxious that her
liking for him should—”</p>

<p>“Die a natural death. I understand,” interrupted
Lady Lochinvar. “You may be sure I will
not encourage the young lady to talk about Mr.
Castellani.”</p>

<p>Mildred explained her responsibility with regard
to Pamela and the young lady’s position, with its
substantial attraction for the adventurer in search of
a wife. She had deemed it her duty to confide thus
much in Lady Lochinvar, lest Castellani should
change his tactics, and pursue Pamela with addresses
which might be only too readily accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>She left the Palais Montano at two o’clock, and
drove round the bay to St. Jean, where the rose-hedges
were in flower, and where the gardens
were bright with bloom under a sky which suggested
an English June.</p>

<p>She left the fly at the little inn where the holiday
people go to eat bouillabaisse on Sundays and
fête-days, but which was silent and solitary to-day,
and then walked slowly along the winding road,
looking for the Bout du Monde. The place was
prettier and more rustic, after an almost English
fashion, than any spot she had seen since she left
Enderby. Villas and cottages were scattered in a
desultory way upon different levels, under the shelter
of precipitous cliffs, and on every bit of rising
ground and in every hollow there were orange and
lemon groves, with here and there a peach or
a cherry in full bloom, and here and there a vivid
patch of flowers, and here and there a wall covered
with the glowing purple of the Bougainvilliers.
Great carouba-trees rose tall and dark amidst all this
brightness, and through every opening in the foliage
the changeful colour of the Mediterranean shone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
in the distance, like the jasper sea of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Mildred went slowly along the dusty road,
looking at all the villas, lingering here and there at
a garden gate, and asking any intelligent-looking
person who passed to direct her to the Bout du
Monde. It was not till she had made the inquiry
half-a-dozen times that she obtained any information;
but at last she met with a bright-faced market-woman,
tramping home with empty baskets after a
long morning at Nice, and white with the dust of
the hillside.</p>

<p>“Le Bout du Monde? But that was the villa
where the poor young English lady lived whose
husband threw her over the cliff,” said the woman
cheerily. “The proprietor changed the name of the
house next season, for fear people should fancy it
was haunted if the story got about. It is called
Montfleuri now.”</p>

<p>“Is there any one living there?” Mildred asked.</p>

<p>No, it was let last year to an English family.
O, but an amiable family, rich, ah, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">richissime</i>,
who had bought flowers in heaps of the speaker.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
But they had left, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malheureusement</i>. They had
returned to their property near London, a great
and stupendous property in a district which the
flower-woman described as le Crommu-elle Rodd.
There had never been such a family in St. Jean—five
English servants, three English mees who
mounted on horseback daily: a benefaction for the
whole village. Now, alas! there was no one living
at Montfleuri but an old woman in charge.</p>

<p>“Could you take me to the house?” asked
Mildred, opening her purse.</p>

<p>The woman would have been all politeness and
good-nature without the stimulant offered by that
open purse. She had all the southern kindliness
and alacrity to oblige, but when the lady dropped
half-a-dozen francs into her broad brown hand she
almost sank to the earth in a rapture of gratitude.</p>

<p>“Madame shall see the house from garret to
cellar if she wishes,” she exclaimed. “I know the old
woman in charge. She is as deaf as one of those
stones yonder,” pointing to a block of blue-gray
stone lying amidst the long rank grass upon the
shelving ground between the road and the sea; “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
if madame will permit <em>I</em> will show her the house.
Madame is perhaps interested in the story of that
poor lady who was murdered.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that she was murdered?”
asked Mildred indignantly. “You cannot know.”</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders with a
dubious air.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais</i>, madame. Nobody but the good God can
know: but most of us thought that the Englishman
pushed his wife over the cliff. They did not live
happily together. Their cook was a cousin of mine,
a young woman who went regularly to confession,
and would not have spoken falsely for all the world,
and she told me there was great unhappiness between
them. The wife was often in tears; the husband
was often angry.”</p>

<p>“But he was never unkind. Your cousin must
know that he was never unkind.”</p>

<p>“Alas! my cousin lies in the same burial-ground
yonder with the poor lady,” answered the woman,
pointing to the white crest of the hill above Villefranche,
where the soldiers were being drilled in the
dusty barrack-yard under the cloudless blue. “She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
is no more here to tell the story. But no, she did
not say the husband was unkind; he was grave and
sad; he was not happy. Tears, tears and reproaches,
sad words from her, day after day; and from him
silence and gloom. Poor people like us, who work
for our bread, have no leisure for that kind of unhappiness.
‘I would rather stand over my <em>casseroles</em>
than sit in a <em>salon</em> and cry,’ said my cousin.”</p>

<p>“It is cruel to say he caused her death, when
you know he was never unkind to her,” said Mildred,
as they walked side by side; “a patient, forbearing
husband does not become a murderer all at once.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but continual dropping will wear a stone,
madame. She may have tried him too much with
her tears. He went out of his mind after her death.
Would he have gone mad, do you think, if he had
not been guilty?”</p>

<p>“He was all the more likely to go mad, knowing
himself innocent, and finding himself accused of a
dreadful crime.”</p>

<p>“Well, I cannot tell; I know most of us thought
he had pushed her over the cliff. I know the young
man who was their gardener said if he had had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
wife with that kind of temper he would have thrown
her down the well in his garden.”</p>

<p>They were at the Villa Montfleuri by this time,
a long, low white house, with a stone terrace overlooking
the harbour of Villefranche. The woman
opened the gate, and Mildred followed her into the
garden and to the terrace upon which the principal
rooms opened. There was a latticed verandah in
front of the <em>salon</em> and dining-room, over which roses
and geraniums were trained, and above which the
purple Bougainvilliers spread its vivid bloom. The
orange-trees grew thick in the orchard, and in their
midst stood the stone well down which the gardener
said he would have thrown a discontented wife.</p>

<p>The caretaker was not in the house, but all the
doors were open. Mildred went from room to room.
The furniture was the same as it had been seventeen
years ago, the woman told Mildred—furniture of the
period of the First Empire, shabby, and with the air
of a house that is let to strangers year after year,
and in which nobody takes any interest. The clocks
on the mantelpieces were all silent, the vases were
all empty: everything had a dead look. Only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
view from the windows was beautiful with an inexhaustible
beauty.</p>

<p>Mildred lingered in the faded <em>salon</em>, looking at
everything with a melancholy interest. Those two
familiar figures were with her in the room. She pictured
them sitting there together, yet so far apart in the
bitter lack of sympathy—a wife, tormented by jealous
suspicions, no less agonising because they were
groundless; a husband, long-suffering, weary, with
his little stock of marital love worn out under slow
torture. She could see them as they might have
been in those bygone years. George Greswold’s
dark, strong face, younger than she had ever known
it; for when he first came to her father’s house
there had been threads of gray in his dark hair and
premature lines upon the brow which told of corroding
care. She could understand now how those
touches of gray had come in the thick wavy hair
that clustered close on the broad, strongly-marked
brow.</p>

<p>Poor Fay! poor, loving, impulsive Fay!</p>

<p>Child as she had been in those old days in Parchment
Street, Mildred had a vivid conception of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
young companion’s character. She remembered the
quick temper, the sensitive self-esteem, which had
taken offence at the mere suggestion of slight; she
remembered dark hours of brooding melancholy when
the girl had felt the sting of her isolated position,
had fancied herself a creature apart, neglected and
scorned by Mrs. Fausset and her butterfly visitors.
For Mildred she had been always overflowing with
love, and she had never doubted the sincerity of Mildred’s
affection; but with all the rest of the household,
with every visitor who noticed her coldly, or
frankly ignored her, she was on the alert for insult
and offence. Remembering all this, Mildred could
fully realise Lady Lochinvar’s account of that
unhappy union. A woman so constituted would
be satisfied with nothing less than a passionate, all-absorbing
love from the man she loved.</p>

<p>The rooms and the garden were haunted by those
mournful shades—two faces pale with pain. She,
too, had suffered those sharp stings of jealousy;
jealousy of a past love, jealousy of the dead; and she
knew how keener than all common anguish is that
agony of a woman’s heart which yearns for sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
possession over past, present, and future in the life
of the man she loves.</p>

<p>The market-woman sat out in the sunshine on
the terrace, and waited while Mildred roamed about
the garden, picturing that vanished life at every step.
There was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berceau</i>, the delight of a southern
garden, a long, green alley, arched with osiers, over
which the brown vine-branches made a network, open
to the sunlight and the blue sky now, while the vine
was still leafless, but in summer-time a place of
coolness and whispering leaves. There was the
fountain—or the place where a fountain had once
been, and a stone bench beside it. They had sat
there perhaps on sunny mornings, sat there and
talked of their future, full of hope. They could not
have been always unhappy. Fay must have had
her bright hours; and then, no doubt, she was dear
to him, full of a strange fascination, a creature of
quick wit and vivid imagination, light and fire embodied
in a fragile earthly tenement.</p>

<p>The sun was nearing the dark edge of the promontory
when Mildred left the garden, the woman
accompanying her, waiting upon her footsteps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
sympathising with her pensive mood, with that instinctive
politeness of the southern, which is almost
as great a delight to the stranger from the hard,
cold, practical north, as the colour of the southern
sea, or the ever-varying beauty of the hills.</p>

<p>“Will you show me the place where the English
lady fell over the cliff?” Mildred asked; and the
woman went with her along the winding road, and
then upward to a path along the crest of a cliff, a
cliff that seemed low on account of those bolder
heights which rose above it, and which screened this
eastward-fronting shore of the little peninsula from
all the world of the west. The carriage-road wound
southward up to the higher ground, but Mildred and
her guide followed a footpath which had been trodden
on the long rank grass beside the cliff. The rosemary
bushes were full of flower: pale, cold gray
blossoms, as befitted the herb of death, and a great
yellow weed made patches of vivid colour among the
blue-gray stones scattered in the long grass on the
slope of the hill.</p>

<p>“It was somewhere along this pathway, madame,”
said the woman. “I cannot tell you the exact spot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
Some fishermen from Beaulieu picked her up,” pointing
across the blue water of the bay to a semicircle
of yellow sand, with a few white houses scattered
along the curving road, and some boats lying keel
upward on the beach. “She never spoke again.
She was dead when they found her there.”</p>

<p>“Did they see her fall?”</p>

<p>“No, madame.”</p>

<p>“And yet people have dared to call her husband
a murderer.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but, madame, it was the general opinion.
Was it not his guilty conscience that drove him mad?
He came here once only after he left the madhouse,
wandered about the village for an hour or two, went
up to the cemetery and looked once—but once only—at
the poor lady’s grave, and then drove away as
if devils were hunting him. Who can doubt that
it was his hand that sent her to her death?”</p>

<p>“No one would believe it who knew him.”</p>

<p>“Everybody at St. Jean believed it, even the
people who liked him best.”</p>

<p>Mildred turned from her sick at heart. She
gave the woman some more money, and then with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
briefest adieu walked back to the inn where she had
left the carriage, and where the horse was dozing
with his nose in a bag of dried locust fruit, while
his driver sprawled half asleep upon the rough stone
parapet between the inn and the bay.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Pamela received her aunt graciously on her return
to the hotel, and seemed in better spirits than she
had been since she left Pallanza.</p>

<p>“Your Lady Lochinvar has written me the
sweetest little note, asking me to dine with her and
go to the opera afterwards,” she said. “I feel sure
this must be your doing, aunt.”</p>

<p>“No, dear. I only told her that I had a very
nice niece moping at the hotel, and very tired of my
dismal company.”</p>

<p>“Tired of you? No, no, aunt. You know better
than that. I should no more grow tired of you than
I should of Box,” intending to make the most flattering
comparison; “only he had made himself a part
of our lives at Pallanza, don’t you know, and one
could not help missing him.” (The pronoun meant
Castellani, and not the dog.) “I am glad I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
going to the opera after all, even if it does remind
me of him; and it’s awfully kind of Lady Lochinvar
to send her carriage for me. I only waited to see
you before I began to dress.”</p>

<p>“Go, dearest; and take care to look your
prettiest.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t mind dining alone?”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to know you are enjoying
yourself.”</p>

<p>The prospect of an evening’s solitude was an
infinite relief to Mildred. She breathed more freely
when Pamela had gone dancing off to the lift, a fluffy,
feathery mass of whiteness, with hooded head and
rosy face peeping from a border of white fox. The
tall door of the <em>salon</em> closed upon her with a solemn
reverberation, and Mildred was alone with her own
thoughts, alone with the history of her husband’s
past life, now that she had unravelled the tangled
skein and knew all.</p>

<p>She was face to face with the past, and how did
it seem in her eyes? Was there no doubt, no agonising
fear that the man she had loved as a husband
might have slain the girl she had loved as a sister?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
All those people, those simple and disinterested
villagers, who had liked George Ransome well enough
for his own sake, had yet believed him guilty: they
who had been on the spot, and had had the best
opportunities for judging the case rightly.</p>

<p>Could she doubt him, she who had seen honour
and fine feeling in every act of his life? She remembered
the dream—that terrible dream which
had occurred at intervals; sometimes once in a year;
sometimes oftener; that awe-inspiring dream which
had shaken the dreamer’s nerves as nothing but a
vision of horror could have shaken them, from which
he had awakened more dead than alive, completely
unnerved, cold drops upon his pallid brow, his hands
convulsed and icy, his eyes glassy as death itself.
The horror of that dream even to her, who beheld
its effect on the dreamer, was a horror not to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Was it the dream of a murderer, acting his crime
over again in that dim world of sleep, living over
again the moment of his temptation and his fall?
No, no! Another might so interpret the vision,
but not his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“I know him,” she repeated to herself passionately;
“I know him. I know his noble heart. He
is incapable of one cruel impulse. He could not
have done such a deed. There is no possible state
of feeling, no moment of frenzy, in which he would
have been false to his character and his manhood.”</p>

<p>And then she asked herself if Fay had not been
her sister, if there had not been that insurmountable
bar to her union with George Greswold, would her
knowledge of his first wife’s fate, and the suspicion
that had darkened his name, have sufficed to part
them? Could she, knowing what she now knew,
knowing that he had been so suspected, knowing
that it was beyond his power ever to <em>prove</em> his guiltlessness—could
she have gone though the rest of her
life with him, honouring him and trusting him as
she had done in the years that were gone?</p>

<p>She told herself that she could have so trusted
him; that she could have honoured and loved him
to the end, pitying him for those dark experiences,
but with faith unshaken.</p>

<p>“A murderer and a madman,” she said to herself,
repeating Castellani’s calumny. “Murderer I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
would never believe him; and shall I honour him
less because that sensitive mind was plunged in
darkness by the horror of his wife’s fate?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Pamela came home before midnight. Lady
Lochinvar had driven her to the door. She was in
high spirits, and charmed with her ladyship, and
thought her ladyship’s nephew, Mr. Stuart, late of
a famous Highland regiment, a rather agreeable
person.</p>

<p>“He is decidedly plain,” said Pamela, “and
looks about as intellectual as Sir Henry Mountford,
and he evidently doesn’t care a jot for music; but he
has very pleasant manners, and he told me a lot
about Monte Carlo. A brother officer of his, bronchial,
with a very nice wife, came to Lady Lochinvar’s
box in the evening, and she is going to call for me
to-morrow afternoon, to take me to the tennis-ground
at the Cercle de la Méditerranée, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“My dearest, you know I wish only to see you
happy and with nice people. I suppose this lady,
whose name you have not told me—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Murray. She is very Scotch, but quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
charming—nothing fast or rowdy about her—and
devoted to her invalid husband. He does not play
tennis, poor fellow, but he sits in the sun and looks
on, which is very nice for him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Murray made her appearance at two o’clock
next day, and Mildred was pleased to find that
Pamela had not exaggerated her merits. She was
very Scotch, and talked of Lady Lochinvar as “a
purpose woman,” with a Caledonian roll of the <em>r</em> in
purpose which emphasised the word in its adjectival
sense. She had very pretty simple manners, and
was altogether the kind of young matron with whom
a feather-headed girl might be trusted.</p>

<p>Directly Pamela and her new friend had departed
Mildred put on her bonnet, and went out on foot.
She had made certain inquiries through Albrecht,
and she knew the way she had to go upon the pilgrimage
on which she was bent, a pilgrimage of
sorrowful memory. There was a relief in being quite
alone upon the long parade between the palm-trees
and the sea, and to know that she was free from
notice and sympathy for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>She walked to the Place Massena, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
accepted the beseeching offers of one of the numerous
flymen, and took her seat in a light victoria behind
a horse which looked a little better fed than his neighbours.
She told the man to drive along the west
bank of the Paillon, on the road to St. André.</p>

<p>Would not Madame go to St. André, and see the
wonderful grotto, and the petrifactions?</p>

<p>No, Madame did not wish to go so far as St.
André. She would tell the driver where to stop.</p>

<p>The horse rattled off at a brisk pace. They are
no crawlers, those flys of the South. They drove
past the smart shops and hotels on the quay; past
the shabby old inn where the diligences put up, a
hostelry with suggestions of the past, when the old
Italian town was not a winter rendezvous for all the
nations, the beaten track of Yankee and Cockney,
<em>calicot</em> and counter-jumper, Russian prince and
Hebrew capitalist, millionaire and adventurer. They
drove past the shabby purlieus of the town, workmen’s
lodging-houses, sordid-looking shops, then an
orange-garden here and there within crumbling
plaster walls, and here and there a tavern in a shabby
garden. To the left of the river, on a sharp pinnacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
of hill, stood the Monastery of Cimies, with dome
and tower dominating the landscape. Further away,
on the other side of the stony torrent-bed, rose the
rugged chain of hills stretching away to Mentone
and the Italian frontier, and high up against the blue
sky glimmered the white domes of the Observatory.
They came by and by to a spot where, by the side of
the broad high-road, there was a wall enclosing a
white dusty yard, and behind it a long white house
with many windows, bare and barren, staring blankly
at the dry bed of the torrent and the rugged brown
hills beyond. At each end of the long white building
there was a colonnade with iron bars, open to the sun
and the air, and as Mrs. Greswold’s carriage drew near
a man’s voice rolled out the opening bars of “Ah,
che la morte!” in a tremendous baritone. A cluster
of idlers had congregated about the open gate, to
stare and listen; for the great white house was a
madhouse, and the grated colonnades right and left
of the long façade were the recreation-grounds of the
insane—of those worst patients who could not be
trusted to wander at their ease in the garden, or to dig
and delve upon the breezy hills towards St. André.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>The singer was a fine-looking man, dressed in
loose garments of some white material, and with long
white gloves. He flung himself on to an upper bar
of the grating with the air of an athlete, and hung
upon the bars with his gloved hands, facing that
cluster of loafers as if they had been an audience in
a theatre, and singing with all the power of a herculean
physique. Mildred told her driver to stop at
the gate, and she sat listening while the madman
sang, in fitful snatches of a few bars at a time, but
with never a false note.</p>

<p>That cage, and the patients pacing up and down,
or hanging on to the bars, or standing staring at the
little crowd round the gate, moved her to deepest pity,
touched her with keenest pain. He had been here,
her beloved, in that brief interval of darkest night.
She recalled how in one of his awakenings from that
torturing dream he had spoken words of strange
meaning—or of no meaning, as they had seemed to
her then.</p>

<p>“The cage—the cage again!” he had cried
in an agonised voice; “iron bars—like a wild
beast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>These words had been an enigma to her then.
She saw the answer to the riddle <em>here</em>.</p>

<p>She sat for some time watching that sad spectacle,
hearing those broken snatches of song, with intervals
of silence, or sometimes a wild peal of laughter.</p>

<p>The loiterers were full of speculations and assertions.
The porter at the gate answered some questions,
turned a deaf ear to others.</p>

<p>The singer was a Spanish nobleman who had lost
a fortune at Monte Carlo the night before, and had
been brought here bound hand and foot at early
morning. He had tried to kill himself, and now he
imagined himself a famous singer, and that the
barred colonnade was the stage of the Grand Opéra
at Paris.</p>

<p>“He’ll soon be all right again,” said the porter
with a careless shrug; “those violent cases mend
quickly.”</p>

<p>“But he won’t get his money back again, poor
devil,” said one of the loiterers, a flyman whose
vehicle was standing by the wall, waiting for a
customer. “Hard to recover his senses and find
himself without a soul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“O, he has rich friends, no doubt. Look at his
white kid gloves. He is young and handsome, and
he has a splendid voice. Somebody will take care of
him. Do you see that old woman sitting over there
in the garden? You would not think there was
anything amiss with her, would you? No more
there is, only she thinks she is the Blessed Virgin.
She has been here five-and-thirty years. Nobody
pities <em>her</em>—nobody inquires about <em>her</em>. My father
remembers her when she was a handsome young
woman at a flower-shop on the Quai Massena, one of
the merriest girls in Nice. Somebody told her she was
neglecting her soul and going to hell. This set her
thinking too much. She used to be at the Cathedral
all day, and at confession as often as the priest
would hear her. She neglected her shop, and quarrelled
with her mother and sisters. She said she
had a vocation; and then one fine day she walked to
the Cathedral in a white veil, with a bunch of lilies
in her hand, and she told all the people she met that
they ought to kneel before her and make the sign of
the cross, for she was the Mother of God. Three
days afterwards her people brought her here. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
would neither eat nor drink, and she never closed her
eyes, or left off talking about her glorious mission,
which was to work the redemption of all the women
upon earth.”</p>

<p>“Drive on to the doctor’s house,” Mildred said
presently; and the fly went on a few hundred yards,
and then drew up at the door of a private house,
which marked the boundary of the asylum garden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greswold had inquired the name of the
doctor of longest experience in the asylum, and she
had been referred to Monsieur Leroy, the inhabitant
of this house, where the flyman informed her some
of the more wealthy patients were lodged. She had
come prepared with a little note requesting the favour
of an interview, and enclosing her card, with the address
of Enderby Manor as well as her hotel in Nice.
The English manor and the Hôtel Westminster indicated
at least respectability in the applicant; and
Monsieur Leroy’s reception was both prompt and
courteous.</p>

<p>He was a clever-looking man, about sixty years
of age, with a fine benevolent head, and an attentive
eye, as of one always on the alert. He had spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
five-and-thirty of his sixty years in the society of the
deranged, and had devoted all his intellectual power
to the study of mental disease.</p>

<p>After briefest preliminary courtesies, Mildred
explained the purpose of her visit.</p>

<p>“I am anxious to learn anything you can tell
me about a patient who was under your care—or, at
least, in this establishment—seventeen years ago,
and in whom I am deeply interested,” she said.</p>

<p>“Seventeen years is a long time, madame, but I
have a good memory, and I keep notes of all my
cases. I may be able to satisfy your curiosity in
some measure. What was the name of this patient?”</p>

<p>“He was an Englishman called Ransome—George
Ransome. He was placed here under peculiar
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpo di Bacco!</i> I should say they were
peculiar, very peculiar circumstances!” exclaimed
the doctor. “Do you know, madame, that Mr.
Ransome came here as a suspected murderer? He
came straight from the gaol at Villefranche, where
he had been detained on the suspicion of having
killed his wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“There was not one jot of evidence to support
such a charge. I know all the circumstances.
Surely, sir, you, who must have a wide knowledge
of human nature, did not think him guilty?”</p>

<p>“I hardly made up my mind upon that point,
even after I had seen him almost every day for six
months; but there is one thing I do know about
this unhappy gentleman: his lunacy was no assumption,
put on to save him from the consequences of a
crime. He was a man of noble intellect, large
brain-power, and for the time being his reason was
totally obscured.”</p>

<p>“To what cause did you attribute the attack?”</p>

<p>“A long period of worry, nerves completely shattered,
and finally the shock of that catastrophe on
the cliff. Whether his hand pushed her to her
death, or the woman flung her life away, the shock
was too much for Mr. Ransome’s weakened and worried
brain. All the indications of his malady, from
the most violent stages to the gradual progress of
recovery, pointed to the same conclusion. The history
of the case revealed its cause and its earlier
phases: an unhappy marriage, a jealous wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
patience and forbearance on his part, until patience
degenerated into despair, the dull apathy of a wearied
intellect. All that is easy to understand.”</p>

<p>“You pitied him, then, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Madame, I pity all my patients; but I found in
Mr. Ransome a man of exceptional characteristics,
and his case interested me deeply.”</p>

<p>“You would not have been interested had you
believed him guilty?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madame, crime is full of interest
for the pathologist. The idea that this gentleman
might have spurned his wife from him in a
moment of aberration would not have lessened my
interest in his mental condition. But although I
have never made up my mind upon the question of
his guilt or innocence, I am bound to tell you, since
you seem even painfully interested in his history,
that his conduct after his recovery indicated an open
and generous nature, a mind of peculiar refinement,
and a great deal of chivalrous feeling. I had many
conversations with him during the period of returning
reason, and I formed a high opinion of his moral
character.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>“Did other people think him guilty—the people
he had known in Nice, for instance?”</p>

<p>“I fancy there were very few who thought much
about him,” answered the doctor. “Luckily for
him and his belongings—whoever they might be—he
had dropped out of society for some time before
the catastrophe, and he had never been a person of
importance in Nice. He had not occupied a villa,
or given parties. He lived with his wife at an
hotel, and the man who lives at an hotel counts for
very little on the Riviera. He is only a casual visitor,
who may come and go as he pleases. His movements—unless
he has rank or fashion or inordinate
wealth to recommend him—excite no interest. He is
not a personage. Hence there was very little talk
about the lamentable end of Mr. Ransome’s married
life. There were hardly half-a-dozen paragraphs
in our local papers, all told; and I doubt if those
were quoted in the <cite>Figaro</cite> or <cite>Galignani</cite>. My patient
might congratulate himself upon his obscurity.”</p>

<p>“Did no one from England visit him during his
confinement here?”</p>

<p>“No one. The local authorities looked after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
his interests so far as to take care of the ready
money which was found in his house, and which
sufficed to pay for the poor lady’s funeral and for
my patient’s expenses, leaving a balance to be
handed over to him on his recovery. From the hour
he left these gates I never heard from him or of him
again; but every new year has brought me an anonymous
gift from London, such a gift as only a person
of refined taste would choose, and I have attributed
those annual greetings to Mr. George Ransome.”</p>

<p>“It would be only like him to remember past
kindness.”</p>

<p>“You know him well, madame?”</p>

<p>“Very well; so well as to be able to answer
with my life for his being incapable of the crime of
which even you, who saw so much of him, hesitate
to acquit him.”</p>

<p>“It is my misfortune, madame, to have seen the
darker sides of the human mind, and to know that
in the whitest life there may be one black spot—one
moment of sin which stultifies a lifetime of
virtue. However, it is possible that your judgment
is right in this particular case. Be assured I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
be glad to think so, and glad to know that Mr.
Ransome’s after days have been all sunshine.”</p>

<p>A sigh was Mildred’s only answer. Monsieur
Leroy saw tears in her eyes, and asked no more.
He was shrewd enough to guess her connection
with his former patient—a second wife, no doubt.
No one but a wife would be so intensely interested.</p>

<p>“If there is anything I can do for you, or for
my old patient—” he began, seeing that his visitor
lingered.</p>

<p>“O, no, there is nothing—except if you would
let me see the rooms in which he lived.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly. It is a melancholy pleasure, at
best, to recall the sorrows we have outlived, but the
association will be less painful in your case since the—friend
in whom you are interested was so speedily
and so thoroughly restored to mental health. I take
it that he has never had a relapse?”</p>

<p>“Never, thank God!”</p>

<p>“It was not likely, from the history of the case.”</p>

<p>He led the way across a vestibule and up-stairs
to the second floor, where he showed Mrs. Greswold
two airy rooms, sitting-room and bedroom communicating,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
overlooking the valley towards Cimies, with
the white-walled convent on the crest of the hill,
and the white temples of the dead clustering near it;
cross and column, Athenian pediment and Italian
cupola, dazzling white against the cloudless blue.
The rooms were neatly furnished, and there was
every appearance of comfort; no suggestion of Bedlam,
padded walls, or strait-waistcoats.</p>

<p>“Had he these rooms all the time?” asked
Mildred.</p>

<p>“Not all the time. He was somewhat difficult
to deal with during the first few weeks, and he was
in the main building, under the care of one of my
subordinates, till improvement began. By that
time I had grown interested in his case, and took
him into my own house.”</p>

<p>“Pray let me see the rooms he occupied at first,
monsieur; I want to know all. I want to be able
to understand what his life was like in that dark
dream.”</p>

<p>She knew now what his own dream meant.</p>

<p>Monsieur Leroy indulged her whim. He took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
her across the dusty garden to the great white house—a
house of many windows and long corridors, airy,
bare, hopeless-looking, as it seemed to that sad
visitor. She saw the two iron-barred enclosures, and
the restless creatures roaming about them, clinging
to the bars, climbing like monkeys from perch to
perch, hanging from the trapeze. The Spaniard had
left off singing.</p>

<p>She was shown George Ransome’s room, which
was empty. The bare whitewashed walls chilled her
as if she had gone into an ice-vault. Here on
everything there was the stamp of a State prison—iron
bars, white walls, a deadly monotony. She was
glad to escape into the open air again, but not until
she had knelt for some minutes beside the narrow
bed upon which George Ransome had lain seventeen
years ago, and thanked God for his restoration of
reason, and prayed that his declining days might be
blessed. She prayed for him, to whom she might
nevermore be the source of happiness, she who
until so lately had been his nearest and dearest
upon earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>A law which she recognised as duty had risen
up between them, and both must go down to the
grave in sadness rather than that law should be
broken.</p>
